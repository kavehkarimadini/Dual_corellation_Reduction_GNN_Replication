       "'WASHINGTON — The Army is asking Congress to shift $24 million in fiscal year 2018 funding to help pay for a demonstration of a hit-to-kill munition critical to its long-range cannon program, according to a reprogramming request dated June 25 and sent to Capitol Hill.\\nThe request is part of a larger omnibus reprogramming document seeking permission from congressional defense committees to reallocate funding from the current and two previous fiscal years.\\nThe munition is important to the Army’s top priority — Long-Range Precision Fires — because it will be used in the service’s Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) weapon system under development.\\nThe reprogrammed funding will allow the Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munitions (C-DAEM) program to move into a competitive demonstration phase in FY20, according to Army budget justification documents.\\nThe C-DAEM effort upgrades the Excalibur airframe with an armored target seeker and will be able to defeat “moving and imprecisely located armored targets at long ranges” and will be fully compatible with the Army’s howitzers as well as ERCA and the M777 Extended-Range version, the reprogramming document notes.\\nThe effort also aims to reduce the cost-per-shot and improve the number of cannon artillery that can be stowed as well as be compliant with the Pentagon’s cluster munition policy.\\nThe reprogramming documents also indicate the munition is a “candidate” for “Multi-Domain Cannon Artillery” that answers a U.S. Army Pacific operational needs statement.\\nThe Army finished an analysis of alternatives in January 2018 that led to a two-increment approach to developing the munition that will replace the 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions with a DOD-compliant munition that addresses anti-armor and extended-range capability.\\nThe first increment will focus on destroying enemy infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled howitzers and tanks while the second increment will take on the destruction of personnel, materiel, air defense artillery and rocket launchers.\\nWhile the increments will be developed simultaneously; FY20 funding will support the competitive demonstrations for Increment I and also the design testing and qualification for Increment II, the FY20 budget books show.\\nThe Army is budgeted to spend $26 million on the program in FY20, but needs the additional $24 million from the FY18 coffer to move forward with the effort.\\nThe Army identified the need for additional dollars for the program as early as spring of 2018, when it submitted a wish list to Congress following the release of the FY19 budget request. The program received $5 million in FY19, but the service indicated in its wish list that another $14 million to test and demonstrate cannon-delivered area effects munitions would be desirable.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Army has approved the Oshkosh-built Joint Light Tactical Vehicle’s transition to full-rate production after a roughly six-month delay, according to a June 21 announcement.\\nFull-rate production for the JLTV was pushed from an original schedule of December 2018 out to May this year due to a number of changes to the Humvee replacement.\\nThe Army decided to make a series of alterations as the result of soldier feedback, including a larger back window and the addition of a muffler. The approach was designed to minimize the cost and quantity of the vehicles that would need to be retrofitted, the vehicle’s program office told Defense News at the time.\\nThe decision to delay the full-rate production did not stop the service from beginning to field 300 of the new vehicles to the Army’s 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Georgia, making it the first unit equipped with the vehicle in April 2019.\\n“We are also grateful for soldier feedback on new features and enhancements,” Jeffrey White, the Army acquisition chief’s principal deputy said in the Army announcement. “The Soldiers of the 1st ABCT, 3rd Infantry Division provided valuable input on enhancements such as increased situational awareness, reduction of system noise, a troop seat kit, and a companion JLTV trailer. Their assessments helped bring us all to a successful Full-Rate Production decision.”\\nOshkosh beat out Humvee-maker AM General and Lockheed Martin in 2015 to build the replacement for the Humvee for both the Army and the Marine Corps. The low-rate initial production, or LRIP, contract was worth $6.7 billion, and the entire program is estimated to be worth $30 billion through 2024.\\n“Important insights from manufacturing and rigorous developmental and operational test during LRIP contributed to shaping the vehicle’s current configuration,” George Mansfield, vice president and general manager of joint programs for Oshkosh Defense, said in a statement sent to Defense News.\\n“The program remains on schedule and on budget, and ensures our troops have the protection, connection, and extreme off-road mobility they need today for current and future battlefields. The JLTV is the only light tactical vehicle being fielded today that can maneuver within combat formations,” he said.\\nAt the time of the LRIP award, a total of 49,100 JLTVs were planned for the Army, not including what the Marine Corps is planning to buy as well as a small number for the Air Force and Navy.\\nThe service cut its procurement of the JLTV in its fiscal 2020 budget request by 863 vehicles. The Army procured 3,393 vehicles in FY19 in LRIP but only plans to buy 2,530 vehicles in FY20. The Army originally planned in its FY19 request to buy 3,035 vehicles in FY20.\\nIt is unclear if more cuts will come for the JLTV. Army Secretary Mark Esper said at the time the FY20 budget rolled out that the vehicle was designed and procured in “the context of Afghanistan and Iraq,” and hence was just not as relevant anymore when applied to the fresh National Defense Strategy now guiding Army investment.\\n“We are certainly cutting the total number” of JLTV procurement, Esper said. “I know that much. But whether it settles out, finals out right here, today, I can’t tell you. In five years, I could maybe have a different number for you.”\\nWhile the JLTV was designed for the counterinsurgency fight — a light vehicle with the protection to endure the blast of an improvised explosive device much like mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles — Oshkosh has used the JLTV’s highly configurable design to increase firepower options on board a JLTV and to protect it from missile and rocket attacks.\\nOver the past three years, it integrated remote weapon systems, a lightweight 30mm cannon paired with a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, a Javelin integration kit, several .50-caliber machine guns, and a lightweight automatic chain gun, among other weapon systems.\\nThe IMI Iron Fist Active Protection System and Rafael’s Trophy Light APS have both been integrated onto JLTVs for evaluation.\\nAnd the Boeing Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense launcher, which was not selected by the Army for its interim SHORAD solution, was also integrated onto the JLTV to include an M3P .50-caliber machine gun, M299 launcher with four Longbow Hellfire missiles, a sensor suite, and a communications suite with the Thales VRC-111.\\nNow that the Army has approved full-rate production for the JLTV, it is anticipated Foreign Military Sales prospects could begin more rapid materialization. Slovenia has already placed an order for a small number of JLTVs, and it’s likely the United Kingdom as well as Lithuania will be future customers.\\nLONDON — The high costs of supporting F-35s and a failure to quickly integrate the MBDA Meteor missile to the aircraft could slow British plans to buy more of the jets, defence secretary Ben Wallace warned June 23.\\nWallace told Britain’s Parliamentary defence select committee that he had the budget to buy more than the 48 jets the military has already ordered, but wanted to see progress controlling maintenance costs and fair treatment for integrating Meteor.\\n“Its important for me to say to BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin and all the other [ contractors] that ‘It’s in your interest to keep through-life support costs down’ because simply, I don’t want to be held to a massive bill I can’t get out of,” he said.\\n“Also it’s important that we continue the planned integration of Meteor on the F-35, I don’t want to be put to the back of the queue for that and it’s in all your interests that if you want me to carry on buying F-35 that we keep a lid on those costs and that we are treated fairly integrating a European made missile [on the jet].\\n“We need more than 48 and we will invest in more than 48, but I’m not in the business of giving a blank check to contractors if they don’t play their part in cost controls, support and indeed making sure Britain’s developed capabilities are put on them [ the F-35], \" Wallace told lawmakers.\\nBritain originally said it would buy 138 jets, but recently has become rather vague on when, and how many, fighters it will eventually buy.\\nThe British plan to have the Meteor and MBDA’s Spear precision ground attack missiles in service on the F-35Bs operated by the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force by around 2024.\\nBritish and U.S. Marine F-35Bs flying from the deck of the carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth mounted the first combat mission from the new ship earlier this week, striking Daesh targets in the Middle East.\\nBritish Typhoon jets have been operating with Meteor since 2018, replacing Raytheon AMRAAM missiles.\\nSTUTTGART, Germany — In less than two years, NATO hopes to have its own, modified version of the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) up and running.\\nAlliance members agreed at the 31st annual summit, held June 14 in Brussels, to launch a new initiative dubbed the Defence Innovation Accelerator of the North Atlantic, or DIANA, meant to speed up trans-Atlantic cooperation on critical technologies, and help NATO work more closely with private-sector entities, academia and other non-governmental entities.\\nThe goal is to have DIANA reach initial operating capability (IOC) by 2023, David van Weel, assistant secretary-general for emerging security challenges, said at a Tuesday virtual roundtable with reporters. By next year, the hope is to have “the initial parts … starting to come up into fruition,” he added.\\nIn the long term, DIANA will have headquarters both in North America and in Europe, and link to existing test centers throughout NATO member countries that will be used for “validating, testing, and co-designing applications in the field of emerging and disruptive technologies,” van Weel said. DIANA will also be responsible for building and managing a network meant to help relevant startups grow and support NATO’s technology needs via grant programs.\\nThe focus will be on national security and defense purposes, and DIANA will not ask for or solicit companies’ intellectual property, van Weel noted.\\nWhile he singled out artificial intelligence, big-data processing, and quantum-enabled technologies, DIANA is meant to support all seven of the key emerging and disruptive technologies — or EDTs — that NATO has identified as critical for the future. The other four include: autonomy, biotechnology, hypersonics and space.\\nSometimes a technology company may not realize that their product could be viable for the defense community, he added.\\nOne key component of DIANA will be a trusted capital marketplace, where smaller companies can connect with pre-qualified investors who are interested in supporting NATO’s technology efforts. Ensuring that investors are vetted ahead of time will allow NATO to ensure “that the technology will be protected from illicit transfers,” van Weel said.\\nThe fund is modeled after a The U.S. Defense Department set up its own trusted capital marketplace in 2019 as a tool that then-DoD acquisition czar Ellen Lord said could help encourage domestically based venture capitalists to fund national security and defense projects. That marketplace served as inspiration for the announced NATO trusted capital marketplace, per the alliance.\\nMembers also agreed for the first time to build up a venture capital fund to support companies developing dual-use and key technologies that could be useful to NATO, and which will be optional for member-nations to participate in. The NATO Innovation Fund, as it’s called, would have a running time of about 15 years to start, and would be underwritten by about 70 million euro (about $83 million) per year, per van Weel.\\nThe goal is not for NATO headquarters or for its member-nations to run the innovation fund, he noted. “The actual running of a venture capital fund, we believe, should be done by companies that have a broad range of experience in the field.” He cited the U.S.-based capital venture firm In-Q-Tel as an example of the type of partner NATO would seek to run the “day-to-day” business of the fund.\\n“I read somewhere that NATO is not a bank—we’re not,” van Weel said. “But it will be the nations providing the funds, and giving the general direction.”\\nThese two initiatives of a technology accelerator and innovation fund are “hopefully going to … bring the alliance forward into the 21st century,” van Weel said.\\nNATO has previously invested in information technology (IT) and software through the NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA), but the difference with the innovation fund, and DIANA, is that the alliance wants to better connect with early-stage startups, rather than larger software companies or traditional defense firms, van Weel said.\\n“DIANA is not about taking over innovation for the NATO enterprise,” he said. “It’s a different community, and requires different funding mechanisms and different types of engagement.”\\nThese two initiatives have been long awaited and demanded by NATO observers, and versions of both a “DARPA-like” technology accelerator and an alliance-wide investment bank were included in a 2020 list of recommendations by NATO’s advisory group on emerging and disruptive technologies.\\nBut it is still early days. While the IOC goal is 2023, “step one is we want to know from allies what they want to offer to DIANA,” van Weel said. Once the NATO Innovation Fund has its participating members, for example, a charter will be set up that will lay out the funding models, rapid contracting processes, and leadership guidelines.\\n“We are trying to do this as fast as we can,” van Weel assured, but then noted, “we do want to get it right, because … with the startup community, you only get one chance.”\\nROME — The first Kuwaiti Eurofighters with new electronically scanned radars onboard took to the skies in Italy in October for test flights, as engineers in the U.K. provided fresh details on the e-scan radar version they are developing for the RAF’s Typhoons.\\nWith progress being made on yet another version for Germany and Spain’s fighters, the Typhoon now has not one but three e-scan radars in the works after years of delays.\\nThe Kuwaiti jets were spotted taking off from Leonardo’s Caselle facility in northern Italy on Oct. 15 for their first test flight ahead of year-end delivery, part of an order of 28 Typhoons by the Gulf state which will boast the so-called Eurofighter Common Radar System Mk 0.\\nBuilt by the Euroradar consortium teaming Leonardo Italy, Leonardo UK, Spain’s Indra and Germany’s Hensoldt, the Mk 0 will also equip Qatar’s 24 Typhoons.\\nHensoldt and Indra are meanwhile working on an upgrade – the Mk 1 version, which will use transmit/receive modules built in Germany to retrofit roughly 130 German and Spanish aircraft in the mid-2020s.\\nGoing it alone, the UK has developed an Mk 2 which features new components and has been offered to possible Typhoon customer Finland, while Italy, which has long held faith with the Typhoon’s current mechanically scanned Captor radar, decided to sign up to Mk 2 in September.\\nWith financing due to be freed up by Rome on a step-by-step basis, 16 engineers from Leonardo Italy will work on secondment in the UK over the next 18 months to learn about the new radar.\\nThey will cross a firewall to work with British colleagues at Leonardo UK, which has been managing the program for the British Ministry of Defence.\\nWhat is well known is that Mk 2 will differ from its fellow Typhoon e-scan radars by offering wideband electronic-attack and electronic-warfare features in addition to more traditional radar capability.\\nFurther innovations will include the ability to passively register emissions from targets and threats providing data that can be fused with data received by the Typhoon’s Defensive Aid Sub-System (DASS) and Pirate infra-red sensor.\\nThe radar will also be able to transmit data, something described as “essential” by Ross Wilson, Leonardo UK’s Typhoon Chief Engineer for Fire Control Radar.\\nWASHINGTON — For the defense industry, creating hybrid and fully electric vehicles for the U.S. Army isn’t about being eco-friendly: it’s about making soldiers more lethal and survivable.\\nThe trucks increasingly feature radars, radios, weapons and other power-hungry mission modules. The Army wants the ability to operate quietly and to lessen its heat signature, pointing toward battery power rather than a running motor. And the less troops rely on refueling, the more agile they are during operations.\\nTo bring these benefits and more to the battlefield, GM Defense is taking a swing at fully electric vehicles. With parent company General Motors making a $35 billion investment in the underlying technology for its Ultium base platform used in commercial vehicles, GM Defense President Steve duMont said he can leverage that work for the Army.\\nAfter GM Defense won the Infantry Squad Vehicle contract in 2020, the company used its own research and development dollars to rip out the internal combustion engine and put in a fully electric motor. That’s still an internal effort, but the company sold a Hummer EV to the Army so the service can begin testing the Ultium technology in a tactically relevant environment, duMont said.\\nHe believes it’s “inevitable” the Army will get to an all-electric fleet due to the operational benefits. But he acknowledged there’s not much of an infrastructure yet to recharge these vehicles at the tactical edge.\\nThat leads him to two ideas: GM Defense and its partners can pursue hybrid technologies as a steppingstone, and they can pursue concepts to bring power to the battlefield.\\nPlasan North America’s All-Terrain Electric Mission Module, or ATeMM, seeks to address both. The modules can be remotely controlled or towed behind a lead vehicle.\\nJohn Cavedo, the company’s president, said ATeMM started as an effort to create a smart trailer that could better traverse tough terrain under its own power behind a lead vehicle. It morphed into something much more.\\n“I am quite convinced that this can replace towed generators, this can replace towed trailers, this can potentially augment or replace some of the Robotic Combat Vehicle-Light platforms that people are looking at. So I think this is really a multitool,” Cavedo said.\\nGM Defense is eyeing the trailer as a means to recharge all-electric vehicles in the field. But Cavedo said the ATeMM has the potential to become a mobile microgrid as well, or to convert gas-powered vehicles into hybrids.\\nTechnology and innovation manager Dan Jakiela explained the ATeMM could push the lead vehicle to which its hitched, either creating better fuel economy while the vehicle’s motor is running, or allowing for so-called silent watch mode, which lets the vehicle run its communications systems and sensors while the motor is off.\\n“How do we leverage 100,000 existing tactical wheeled vehicles that are already in the fleet? How do we leverage those millions of dollars that have already been spent, and be able to hybridize those vehicles as an interim bridge, as other companies such as GM Defense come along with a purpose-built hybrid or with a purpose-built EV? This can become a great bridge,” Cavedo said.\\nThese purpose-built hybrid systems are taking shape in different ways, with General Dynamics Land Systems creating distinct platforms to optimize different features of its ground vehicles. For its part, BAE Systems is opting for a common system that can be scaled to support vehicles of different sizes.\\nTim Reese, the director of business development for GDLS, said its StrykerX hybrid is optimized to move at high speeds and longer distances on battery-only power, allowing for silent operations when needed. The AbramsX tank, on the other hand, sought to reduce the size of the engine, which is quite large to allow the platform to perform in the most strenuous conditions. Its hybrid electric drive was focused on using a smaller and lighter engine that can provide enough power for the bulk of the tank’s operating profile, with the battery providing an extra boost in especially tough conditions.\\nBAE Systems has a scalable hybrid system that can fit vehicles of 30-60 tons, which covers the whole portfolio except the Abrams tank and the recovery vehicle, according to the company’s director of business development, Jim Miller.\\nBAE has already delivered two hybrid Bradley fighting vehicles to the Army for testing, which Miller said have already gone to several exercises.\\nThe service may go on to test a whole platoon or company of these vehicles before committing to the hybrid system when they fully understand the technology and the operational benefits. Miller said he hopes success with Bradley vehicles could pave the way for adding hybrid drives to howitzers, Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles and more.\\n“You’d have a common hybrid-electric-drive platform in the brigade, which, if the Army wants that and can afford that, that could be a really substantial step for them to take,” Miller added.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Marine Corps intends to replace some decades-old Hellfire missiles with a family of long-range loitering munitions, giving its attack helicopters greater range and lethality for a fight in the Pacific region.\\nThis move comes as part of the Corps’ ongoing Force Design 2030 modernization effort to prepare the service to deter or win a fight against China and other potential adversaries.\\nThe Marine Corps on Monday released an annual status update on Force Design efforts, which included a nod to the service’s Long-Range Attack Munition effort supported by the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, “to rapidly develop and field a low-cost, air launched family of loitering, swarming munitions.”\\nIn a June 2 call with reporters, Brig. Gen. Stephen Lightfoot, director of the Capabilities Development Directorate, noted that as an AH-1 pilot, he has firsthand experience with the Hellfire missile. Depending on the helicopter’s altitude, a pilot might get 8 kilometers (5 miles) of range from the weapon.\\n“That’s great in [Operation Iraqi Freedom], [Operation Enduring Freedom] and areas we’ve been fighting in for years. But when you move over to the Indo-Pacific and some of the distances we’re talking about, 8 kilometers doesn’t really do as much as you’d want,” Lightfoot said.\\nNoting that the last H-1 attack helicopters were delivered last year and that the Corps will operate them for several more decades, he said the service must now pursue both evolutionary and revolutionary ideas to keeping these aircraft relevant to the fight.\\nThe service is already experimenting with these long-range, loitering, swarming munitions and expects to field them “within the next few years,” Lightfoot noted.\\n“That is a capability that brings hundreds of kilometers, and that allows us to be able to use a current platform to be able to do things that we never thought we’d be able to do,” Lightfoot said, calling this development effort “critical.”\\nThese munitions would also be operable from ground launchers, he added.\\nWhile the helicopters’ own range and maneuverability would enhance the munitions’ capability, Lightfoot said, aircraft aren’t always in the air. To ensure Marines operating forward have round-the-clock access to long-range offensive weapons, he said the service would pursue a launcher for use by ground troops.\\nIn a separate interview on the Force Design update, Scott Lacy, the deputy director of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, said the organization is working on this effort with the aviation community. The work includes studying munitions already on the market as well as other experimental capabilities.\\nThe Force Design annual update noted “other projects include developing a common launcher for the family of ground launched loitering munitions and testing a low-cost, hypersonic booster in a form factor the Marine Corps can logistically support in a contested environment.”\\nLacy did not elaborate much on the hypersonic booster, other than to say experimentation is ongoing at the lab.\\nIn the same interview, Col. Daniel Wittnam, the director of the Marine Corps Integration Division, described another long-range offensive fires effort in which the service is involved, in conjunction with the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\\nThe office provided money for the Corps to experiment using the Maritime Strike Tomahawk — a derivative of the legacy Tomahawk land-attack missile that the office directed in fiscal 2017 — as a land-based weapon.\\nMarines will use the Naval Strike Missile as their first ground-based, anti-ship missile but have previously said they intend to pursue other longer-range weapons for the future.\\nWittnam said the 11th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton, California, was standing up a battery to work with the Maritime Strike Tomahawk.\\nThe question the Marines have as they consider this and other emerging capabilities is whether the technology is naval and expeditionary, given their focus on littoral operations in the Pacific, the colonel said.\\nHe noted the current form factor is not, but he said the experimentation would continue. (The proof-of-concept system would mount the missile launcher on a Joint Light Tactical Vehicle chassis, a setup that already had a tip-over incident due to the center of gravity being off.)\\nLt. Gen. Karsten Heckl, the deputy commandant for combat development and integration, told reporters during the June 2 roundtable that not all the ongoing experiments would be successesful, but the Corps would learn from all of them as it rapidly modernizes.\\n“I don’t have the luxury of, (A) test something, (B) get the feedback, (C) let’s make changes. You know, that takes years and years. We have to iterate and, if necessary, fail quickly and learn faster, and then iterate again,” he said.\\nIn doing so, Heckl added, “we have made the fleet more capable. Period. Full stop.”\\nWASHINGTON — BAE Systems has decided it won’t participate in the U.S. Army’s competition to acquire an Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, which will ultimately replace the company’s Bradley fighting vehicle in the service’s inventory.\\n“After careful consideration we have decided not to move forward with OMFV,” Jim Miller, senior business development director for combat vehicles at BAE told Defense News in an exclusive June 7 interview.\\n“I really want to be clear that we are not making a statement about the viability of the OMFV program or the veracity of the requirements or any of that stuff; this is just a business decision we’ve made,” Miller said.\\nThe Army issued a request for proposals to competitively build OMFV prototypes, a major effort within its Next-Generation Combat Vehicle portfolio, in March, and there was every expectation that BAE would submit an offering.\\nBAE told Defense News in October at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference that its CV90 Mark IV was a good jumping off point to develop and build the Army’s Bradley replacement.\\nThe Army decided last year that it would cut back on upgrade plans for the Bradley vehicle in order to free up funding to move forward quickly with the OMFV plans.\\nThe OMFV is intended to replace the Bradley starting in 2026 and is designed to better operate in future environments that would allow soldiers to maneuver to a position of advantage and “to engage in close combat and deliver decisive lethality during the execution of combined arms maneuver,” according to an Army statement.\\nBut the Army’s fighting vehicle incumbent doesn’t want in on OMFV because, according to Miller, there are a lot of irons in the fire for the company as it looks to fulfill current demand and to delve deeper in future development.\\n“We are really excited about everything that is going on with the Army and Marine Corps,” Miller said. “They are both doing great modernization programs. It’s a really exciting time for all of industry and particularly for us.”\\nBAE is in the middle of five major modernization efforts, which are all in production at some level, Miller said, and the company is committed to continuing with the Bradley A4 upgrades.\\nTwo of those major efforts also fall within the NGCV portfolio: Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) and Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV).\\nBAE is one of two companies selected to competitively provide MPF prototypes — a new armored, tracked vehicle to enhance infantry units’ firepower.\\nAnd it’s building the AMPV for the service as well, delivering the first prototypes to the Army in December 2016.\\nBAE is also in low-rate production for the M109A7 Self-Propelled Howitzer and companion M992A3 ammunition carrier vehicles under the Paladin Integrated Management (PIM) program.\\nThe company was also chosen last year to build the Marine Corps’ new Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV).\\n“We have had a lot of success and despite all of that success, we still need to be careful about which pursuits we go after and there are so many emerging opportunities right now, we have to pick and choose,” Miller said.\\nOMFV is “certainly in our wheelhouse,” Miller said. “We’ve got systems and products that would fit that opportunity, I think, and could be very successful, but we’ve just made a business decision.”\\nBAE is looking deeper into the future at objective modernization capability 10 times more effective than what the service now has. The Army’s modernization goals aim to reach that level of capability.\\n“We want to go after that objective 10X capability and we want to start focusing on that, and in our mind that is around autonomy and robotics,” Miller noted. “There is a whole series of advanced technologies that are pretty exciting.”\\nFor instance, BAE is involved in the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) program — which aims to extend the range of a cannon out to as much as 70 km — by working to install a longer barrel on its M109A7 Paladin.\\nBAE recently brought a robotic vehicle to a trade show to foster conversation regarding what the service plans to do for its Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) program, which aims to develop robotic vehicles in the light-, medium- and heavy-weight classes to aid forces on the battlefield in a variety of ways.\\n“Our expertise is around the Army’s heavy brigades,” Miller said, “so our robotics will be RCV-Medium and RCV-Heavy.”\\nBut BAE is looking at a wide range of possibilities, not just in full-up vehicles but in “cutting edge technologies” and the company has even set up a lab embedded at the innovative entrepreneur’s hub Capital Factory in Austin, Texas, which is also home to part of Army Futures Command.\\nWhen looking at the wide variety of efforts both in prototyping and research and development within the NGCV portfolio, Miller said, “Each one of these opportunities, we will do the same kind of business analysis,” adding, “we see ourselves as being a key part of the Army’s future in combat vehicles and we are going to remain engaged in all of them.”\\nWASHINGTON — The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will receive a slate of hardware and software upgrades known as Technology Refresh 3 a year later than originally expected, the three-star general in charge of the program told lawmakers Wednesday.\\nThis story is updated with clarified information from Rep. Rob Wittman’s office.\\nWASHINGTON — The military and manufacturers of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter have found a potential solution to the engine troubles that halted deliveries of the jet for nearly two months, a key lawmaker told Defense News on Thursday.\\nThe solution could be available later this month, paving the way for deliveries of the F-35 to resume, said Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va., who chairs the House Armed Services Committee’s tactical air and land forces panel.\\nDuring an interview in his Capitol Hill office, Wittman said engineers identified vibration issues in the fighters’ Pratt & Whitney-made F135 engines as the source of the problem that froze F-35 acceptance flights and subsequent deliveries.\\n“The good news is the Air Force and the contractor, Lockheed [Martin, which builds the F-35], did their due diligence to discover what the issues were there, and to make sure they gathered the data to make sure they put in place a proper solution,” said Wittman, noting he was briefed on the issue Wednesday by F-35 Program Executive Officer Lt. Gen. Michael Schmidt. “I’m very confident that they have properly identified the problem, and that their solution set that they’re going to put in place will solve the problem. They’re doing the adequate testing to make sure that their solution does indeed avoid this particular situation in the future.”\\nWittman’s office later clarified that he intended to refer to engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney as the contractor that did its due diligence.\\nWittman said the solution “should be in hand any day now.” Asked if that meant later in February, he replied: “That’s my understanding.”\\nPratt & Whitney confirmed in a statement to Defense News the development of a near-term solution meant to allow the company to resume delivering F135 engines to F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin by the end of this month.\\n“After thorough review, we can confidently say there were no quality issues with the [engine] fuel tube that fractured,” said Jen Latka, vice president of the F135 program for Pratt & Whitney. “We are dealing with a rare systems phenomenon involving harmonic resonance.\\n“We have developed a near-term remedy that allows the fleet to fly safely, and we expect that F135 engine deliveries could resume before the end of the month.”\\nWhen asked for comment, the F-35 Joint Program Office referred Defense News to Pratt & Whitney’s statement. Lockheed Martin referred questions to the JPO. It is unclear when acceptance flights will resume. Pratt & Whitney did not provide details of the developed fix.\\nLockheed halted acceptance flights of new fighters after a Dec. 15 mishap involving a newly built F-35B in Fort Worth, Texas. Acceptance flights are required to ensure new fighters are working as intended before they are delivered to the government. The pause in those flights had the effect of also stopping deliveries.\\nLockheed has since continued to build and store new F-35s, primarily at its main factory in Fort Worth.\\nVideo of the Dec. 15 mishap showed the fighter hovering near the ground before descending, bouncing, tipping forward until its nose and a wing touched the ground, and starting to spin around. Its Air Force pilot, who was performing a quality check for the Defense Contract Management Agency, then safely ejected.\\nA source familiar with the program told Defense News in December that initial assessments showed a high-pressure fuel tube in the engine of the F-35B had failed. This prompted the JPO to update its safety risk assessments.\\nAnd on Dec. 27, delivery of new F135 engines was paused after what the JPO called a “mutual agreement” involving itself, DCMA, and Pratt & Whitney, while the investigation into the mishap continued.\\nWittman confirmed “there was a problem with the high-pressure fuel-delivery system.”\\nWittman said the solution will involve a “combination of things” to dampen vibrations in the engine, which he called “a very confined ... dynamic environment,” though he was unable to detail the solution.\\nBut figuring out the solution is only the first step, Wittman noted. The contractors involved have to set up a manufacturing process for the fixes, and then go back and install them in the F-35s that Lockheed has built since mid-December. The contractor now has 17 F-35s completed and awaiting acceptance flights.\\nThis solution also needs to be built into the production line for new fighters, Wittman said.\\n“I believe that the Air Force and Lockheed have the solution set in hand, which is the key,” he explained. “Then … how do they incorporate that into existing aircraft and aircraft that are on the assembly line now?”\\nTime is running out to fix the problem and keep F-35 production going, Wittman added. Lockheed has continued building new F-35s using the stock of F135 engines it already had on hand before the December halt in engine deliveries.\\nLockheed still has some engines in reserve to continue building fighters, Wittman said, but not many.\\n“It’s my understanding … that the number of those engines now is very small,” he told Defense News. “So the longer this goes on, you potentially could be at a point where the engine supply is depleted, and then it could impact production.”\\nWittman said all the parties involved in the F-35 are considering factors, such as remaining engine availability, as they deal with the problem.\\nPARIS — Helicopter maker Sikorsky is considering setting up a final assembly line for Black Hawks in the United Kingdom to support a bid for the nation’s New Medium Helicopter program.\\nWhile the Ministry of Defence has yet to release an invitation to tender for the £1 billion ($1.28 billion) modernization program, the Lockheed Martin subsidiary is weighing final assembly options both on the European continent as well as the U.K., company president Paul Lemmo said June 21.\\n“We’re waiting to see what the requirements are, what the structure of the tender is going to be, before we make final decisions,” he told a small group of reporters at the biennial Paris Air Show outside of the city. “We’re not locked in on one path.”\\nThe company could potentially move its final assembly line to the United Kingdom if it wins the contract, or, alternatively, perform final assembly “elsewhere in Europe” and then add final, U.K.-specific modifications to the aircraft in-country, Lemmo said. Should the latter decision prevail, the final assembly would likely take place in Poland at PZL Mielec, which is owned by Lockheed Martin.\\nSikorsky has been in discussions with a number of U.K.-based suppliers to find “the most capable partners” should it opt to perform final assembly and completion in Britain, he noted. A location selection has yet to be made. But the choice to go U.K. or mainland Europe may hinge on what sort of Black Hawk model meets the British defense ministry’s requirements. The potential for future exports also factors into the decision about a proper in-country line.\\n“If they buy a variant that is heavily required by other countries, why wouldn’t we do that?” Lemmo said. “If they buy a variant that looks like every other Black Hawk? Maybe not.”\\nThe ministry released a series of procurement details in May 2022, with plans to procure up to 44 new helicopters to replace the Army’s fleet of 23 Puma systems, and a handful of aging Bell 412, Bell 212 and Airbus Dauphin fleets.\\nLeonardo is pitching their AW149 helicopter, while Airbus has recommended the H175M, a militarized version of their commercial 7-ton utility aircraft. Boeing has stated it will pitch the MH-139 Grey Wolf, which is a modified version of the commercial AW139 platform developed by AgustaWestland – now part of Leonardo.\\nThen-Defence Secretary Ben Wallace made it clear last year that whichever company is selected to provide the New Medium Helicopter must give a portion of the workshare to U.K. workers.\\n“I am not interested in ‘Here today, gone tomorrow’-suppliers for this,” he said at the time.\\nSikorsky’s Lemmo said he was observing “continued” interest in the Black Hawk from European nations during the Paris Air Show, the first since COVID-19 emerged in 2020, and since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.\\nMany of those countries hail from Eastern Europe and are currently operating Soviet-made equipment, he noted. The discussions circle around procuring Black Hawks on a very short timeframe.\\n“They want them inside of our lead time,” Lemmo said. “And so, we are trying to figure out ways to help that. If it’s a foreign military sale, perhaps the Army can let some go off of their production line earlier than normal. If it’s a direct commercial sale, we’re trying to do some work ahead to get aircraft in the pipeline earlier, to deliver earlier.”\\nThe State Department has been working with industry to expedite the FMS sales to nations who are divesting their Soviet-era military equipment to Ukraine, in an effort to both encourage more support to Kyiv and wean these partners quickly off of Russian platforms, a U.S. official told reporters at the air show this week.\\nWASHINGTON — After years of catching grief for exquisite weapons acquisition programs with creeping requirements leading to lengthy delays and budget overruns, the Pentagon now finds itself with a different sort of headache: how to stop weapons and systems that are dirt cheap.\\nThe growing problem of inexpensive unmanned systems employing autonomy and artificial intelligence has been a longtime subject of military study and discussion.\\nBut the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has underscored just how effective smart tech accessible to anyone may be in neutralizing the elaborate tools of conventional warfare. In one example from the war, Ukraine reportedly used a Chinese-made DJI drone worth $2,000 to destroy a Russian T-90 tank worth millions of dollars.\\nDrawing on a newfound urgency, the U.S. undersecretary of defense for research and engineering published a need statement in May, calling on industry to help develop new weapons that can effectively meet the new threat from unmanned, autonomous and AI defense-driven systems.\\n“Multi- and cross-domain Uncrewed Systems (UxS) continue to be a threat to U.S. forces around the world. This threat is expanding in all domestic and international regions,” the need statement begins, citing the directive in the 2022 National Defense Strategy to stay ahead of the problem. “This threat is no longer just in the aerial domain, but also from ground, subterranean, sea, and undersea domains. Near-peer adversary nations are rapidly incorporating robust UxS capabilities into their military formations, and non-state actors are using UxS to increase their asymmetric advantage.”\\nWhile aerial drones have had the most opportunities to make a mark on the battlefield, both in Ukraine and the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in the South Caucasus, undersea systems may not be far behind.\\nUkrainian unmanned underwater vessels, such as the Toloka TLK-150, likely already have been responsible for limiting Russian aggression at sea.\\nAnd in the subterranean realm, expected to become an increasingly critical domain as more conflicts play out in and around big cities, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is working to develop unmanned systems that can navigate the tight and dark spaces.\\nThe newly published need statement calls for weapons that can destroy or stymie uncrewed threats in the following ways:\\nNotably, the Defense Department has provided a Ukraine aid package, announced in April, that included 30 mm gun trucks and laser-guided rocket systems designed to destroy drones. But the new need statement underscores how daunting it is to defeat a cheap, smart threat that keeps coming, no matter how many individual platforms are shot down.\\n“I would say that you should look at this need statement as basically saying: ‘OK, we recognize that these sorts of cheap and extremely numerous drones are likely to be an enduring part of future battlefields,’ ” said Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani Center for AI and Advanced Technologies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.\\nMILAN, Italy — Latvian drone company Atlas Dynamics plans to open in early 2023 a research and development factory in Ukraine and later on a production plant in collaboration with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence.\\nSince the outbreak of the war in February, Atlas Dynamics has delivered a total of 300 Atlas Pro tricopter drones to Ukrainian troops with an additional 75 set to be deployed in mid-January, according to the company’s chief executive. Thus far, small groups have been relying on the drones to find and expose Russian troop locations that can then be relayed to artillery units.\\nThe company is now undergoing a rapid expansion. Previously, its efforts were on increasing global exports, but its attention has now shifted entirely to Ukraine as “it currently has the most incredible experience of modern warfare that is invaluable and can significantly help improve products and create new ones,” founder and CEO Ivan Tolchinsky said. The Riga-based company has also hired Ukrainian refugees to help speed up its production rate.\\nThe company declined to disclose the precise location of the R&D office or the future assembly plant. While the first will be opened in a matter of “months,” according to Tolchinsky, the company is still coordinating with the Ukrainian Ministry on the details of the production facility. Even so, he said cooperation with Kyiv has already begun for “the creation of new products and types of equipment.”\\nAt a weight of 1.9 kilograms (4.1 pounds), the Atlas Pro is much lighter than other platforms seen in Ukraine, and falls under the category of mini-drones, designed primarily for intelligence and surveillance missions as it is resilient against electronic warfare interference. According to Tolchinsky, the concept behind its development was that it had to be simple, convenient and easy enough for all to operate, which is why “we removed the joystick from our first remote as they gave the feeling that it was difficult to control the drone.”\\nIn recent months, unmanned systems have drawn significant attention in Ukraine.\\n“Systems like the Bayraktar TB2 do help Ukraine; it is just that their use requires the cooperation of various branches of the military and other equipment to make its use effective,” Tolchinsky said. “It cannot win the war on its own, nor is it a golden wand but only a cog in a vast machine.”\\nHe adds that although Atlas Dynamics has a long-standing relationship with the Ukrainian MoD and that the Atlas Pro was adapted to their requirements, the first weeks following the invasion showed that not all of them coincided with the realities of the war and changes had to be made. Among them, operators wanted more powerful batteries and larger swarming capabilities.\\nAccording to company projections, the ability to launch and control 50 of these drones at a time will be possible as early as the first quarter of 2023. Tolchinsky further said the company is developing new, higher-resolution cameras alongside other technologies that will be available soon.\\nROME and STUTTGART, Germany — The European Union committed €500 million ($553 million) on Wednesday to beefing up the bloc’s ammunition production lines to better supply Ukraine, saying member states would match the sum with individual contributions.\\nThe total of €1 billion to bolster output from factories across Europe will add to another €2 billion already committed by the EU to compensate members who donate their existing ammunition stocks to Kyiv as well to the joint purchase of fresh stocks to help halt Russia’s invasion.\\nAnnouncing the draft legislation for investing in EU factories, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said, “Ukraine is heroically resisting the brutal Russian invader. We stand by our promise to support Ukraine and its people, for as long as it takes.”\\nThierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, added he was “confident” that the so-called Act in Support of Ammunition Production (ASAP) would push EU output to one million rounds of ammunition a year within 12 months.\\nThe challenge is arming Ukraine for its planned spring offensive with an EU industrial base which has suffered from what the EU called “years of underinvestment.”\\nThe ASAP cash will be used to build new factories producing ammunition and missiles, upgrade existing ones, encourage cross-border partnerships, improve access to raw materials, test and recondition old ammunition stocks and train new staff, the bloc said.\\n“This is not only for the benefit of the Ukrainian armed forces in their fight to defend Ukraine’s sovereignty against the Russian invasion, but also for the security of the European Union,” said Josep Borrell, the bloc’s foreign policy chief.\\nOn Wednesday, Breton tweeted a video of his recent visits to EU production sites including Poland, Slovakia, Croatia, Slovenia, Sweden, Bulgaria, Romania, Finland, France, Czechia, Italy, Austria, and Greece, and previewed future visits to sites in Germany and Spain.\\nThe scheme has been dubbed the third track in a package of measures agreed on in March, starting with the one billion euros to be spent reimbursing members for ammunition stocks donated to Ukraine.\\nTrack two – a plan to spend another billion on the joint purchase by members on new ammunition – has sparked a row over whether the cash needed to be spent within the EU or could be used outside the union to speed up purchasing.\\nThe funds would come from the EU’s off-budget mechanism known as the European Peace Facility (EPF), now holding more than €8 billion.\\nSweden, which currently holds the revolving presidency of the EU Council, announced on Wednesday a deal had been struck.\\nAn EU source told Defense News it was a compromise solution which requires the cash to be spent on ammunition and missiles which have “undergone an important” part of their manufacture in the EU or Norway, including final assembly.\\nPARIS — European missile maker MBDA is leading a consortium of companies to conceptualize a prototype hypersonic interceptor for Europe over the next three years.\\nThe missile systems and technology company has signed letters of intent with four European nations – France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands – to launch a concept stage for the Hypersonic Defense Interceptor Study, or HYDIS2, which would introduce several designs before choosing one, officials said June 19 during the Paris Air Show here.\\nThe consortium includes 19 companies and 30 suppliers from 14 European countries, Bruno Verzotti, MBDA’s director of future systems, told a small group of reporters. Besides the four nations that have signed letters of intent to support HYDIS2, industry partners hail from Finland, Estonia, Sweden, Denmark, Romania, Hungary, Croatia, Austria, Spain and Belgium.\\n“HYDIS2 aims to define Europe’s interceptor,” Verzotti said during the briefing. After the three-year concept study is over, the plan is for the four nations underwriting HYDIS2 to choose one counter-hypersonic interceptor concept to push forward.\\nThe company has been at work on counter-hypersonic technology for roughly the past four years, he said. Internally to MBDA, the capability under development has been dubbed “Aquila,” the Latin word for “eagle.”\\nThe intent is for Aquila’s development to be linked to the EU-funded Timely Warning and Interception with Space-based TheatER Surveillance (TWISTER) program, supported by the EU’s Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) scheme.\\nNearly one year ago, the EU announced its initial roster of 61 programs to be supported by the European Defence Fund (EDF). One of those, the EU HYDEF effort, would cover the concept phase to build a similar endo-atmospheric interceptor, led by a consortium including Spain’s Sener Aerospacial Sociedad Anonima and Germany’s Diehl Defence.\\nThe EU HYDEF program is expected to cost about €110 million ($100.74 million) and cover a 36-month period, the EU previously shared. It is also linked to the PESCO TWISTER program.\\nMBDA also submitted a bid to receive EDF funds to build an interceptor in 2022 under the moniker HYDIS. While their proposal was not selected then, officials are optimistic that a second effort – with the very same industry team – might prove more effective.\\nMeanwhile, Israeli arms maker Rafael announced June 14 that it had developed its own hypersonic interceptor dubbed “Sky Sonic.” The weapon was unveiled for the first time at this year’s Paris Air Show and is on display at the company’s stand.\\nWASHINGTON — U.S. Army Futures Command has given the green light to the Maneuver Capabilities Development and Integration Directorate to develop a plan to equip tactical and combat vehicles with electric power, according to a Sept. 21 statement.\\nThe directorate will begin drafting a requirements document for Tactical and Combat Vehicle Electrification, and will host an industry day Oct. 20 to share its electrification initiatives with industry.\\nCALSTART, an organization that focuses on clean technology transportation, and the Ground Vehicles Systems Center will co-host the event.\\nThe electrification effort aims to decrease the Army’s reliance on fossil fuels. “The requirement also aims to increase operational reach across all maneuver formations through electric propulsion, which offers a variety of operational and tactical benefits,” a statement from the directorate read.\\n“These include the potential to double operational duration, implement silent mobility, increase silent watch, and potentially reduce the Army’s logistical burden by nearly half when fully implemented,” it stated.\\nThe Army launched an earnest effort into electrifying the brigade earlier this spring.\\nLt. Gen. Eric Wesley, then-director of the Futures and Concepts Center within Army Futures Command, told Defense News in March that the effort is easier said than done, and doesn’t just focus on powering a vehicle electrically. Instead, the service would attempt to identify how an entire enterprise meant for supporting electric vehicle fleets and other capabilities could work.\\n“Let’s be clear: We’re behind, we’re late to meet on this thing,” Wesley said. “If you look at all of the analysis, all of the various nations that we work with, they’re all going to electric power with their automotive fleet. And right now, although we do [science and technology] and we’ve got some research and development going on and we can build prototypes, in terms of a transition plan, we are not there.”\\nArmy officials know there will likely be a time where vehicles that use fossil fuels and ones that are all-electric share the battlefield. “What is the distribution plan that enables that?” Wesley wondered. “That is much more complex when you look at the implications for an entire enterprise.”\\nWesley was preparing a proposal for the head of Army Futures Command on how the service might accomplish such an endeavor that could change the paradigm of the logistics and sustainment tails as well as enhance force mobility.\\nThe proposal was intended to make a business case for the Army electrifying the formation, discuss the technical feasibility and describe a transition process.\\nThe Maneuver Capabilities Development and Integration Directorate’s requirements for the development process gives the overall effort traction to move out quickly.\\nWASHINGTON — The Army has disqualified Raytheon and Rheinmetall’s bid for the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle prototype competition, Defense News has learned.\\nThe OMFV is meant to replace the service’s Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle. The Army’s plan was to take the bid samples submitted this week, evaluate them over a period of time and then choose two companies to deliver 14 prototypes each and then would pick a single winner after further evaluation. The Army’s goal was to begin replacing Bradleys in 2026.\\nThe Army would not comment on the disqualification and said in a statement sent to Defense News that the solicitation for the OMFV prototyping effort closed on Oct. 1 and “we are now in the competition sensitive Source Selection Evaluation process.”\\nThe service noted in the statement that it “remains committed to rapidly execute the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle program,” its number two modernization priority.\\nBut multiple sources have confirmed that the bid — Rheinmetall’s Lynx 41 Infantry Fighting Vehicle — was disqualified and the bid sample, the only one in existence, remains in Germany at the company’s facility in Unterluss.\\nThe Army required the competitors to deliver a single bid sample — a full-up working vehicle — to Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, by Oct. 1.\\nThe Lynx has left the Rheinmetall compound several times before, notably to travel to be unveiled in Paris at Eurosatory in June 2018 and again at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference last fall. Raytheon and the Rheinmetall announced at AUSA that they would partner on the OMFV program and submit Lynx as its offering.\\nThe disqualification of the team means that General Dynamics Land Systems’ offering is the only vehicle remaining in the competition. According to sources, no other company submitted. Hanwha, a South Korean defense company, was interested in competing but chose not to participate, multiple sources claim.\\nIndustry sources have said that several companies who wanted to compete or submitted bids had asked for extensions, roughly 90 days in the case of Rheinmetall, to meet requirements.\\nAccording to multiple sources, potential bidders expressed concern to the service that meeting the requirements, the timeline and a combination of the two wasn’t possible.\\nWhat snarled Rheinmetall, for instance, according to sources, was the timeline it needed to get approvals from the local municipal government to transport the vehicle by tractor trailer or rail and then via air.\\nSources said that the company had requested a four-week extension to deliver the vehicle to Aberdeen and also offered to hand over the vehicle to the Army under lock and bond in Germany by the Oct. 1 deadline and both were denied.\\nBut a larger issue, multiple sources conveyed, was the clear differences between what the Army acquisition community and what Army Futures Command wanted to do. Sources confirmed that the acquisition side of the house was willing to agree to extensions, for instance, but AFC, who is in charge of rapid requirements development and prototyping efforts ahead of programs of record, insisted the Army must adhere to the schedule.\\nIndustry also expressed concern to the Army over the roughly 100 mandatory requirements, with just six tradeable ones, expected to be met over 15 months using non-developmental vehicles.\\nBrig. Gen. Ross Coffman, who is in charge of Next-Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) modernization efforts, said at the Defense News Conference in September that he was confident the requirements set for OMFV are appropriate and had no plans to change them.\\nPresently, the OMFV competition is on hold due to a congressionally mandated continuing resolution that prevents the effort from kicking off. The Army had planned to begin the $378 million program in the first quarter after taking receipt of the bid samples at the start of the new fiscal year.\\nAs the Army enters its competition to build prototypes to replace the Bradley, Australia is running a similar effort and recently downselected to two competitors: Rheinmetall’s Lynx and an offering from Hanwha. GDLS was competing but did not make the final cut. Australia laid out just five mandatory requirements for its competition.\\nGDLS has not yet detailed its offering for OMFV but said it was “purpose built” for the U.S. Army.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Air Force wants to send more than 200 aircraft to the boneyard with its fiscal 2022 budget request, freeing up $1.3 billion in savings that it can reinvest in cutting-edge technologies like its sixth-generation fighter and hypersonic weapons.\\nThe Department of the Air Force, which released its budget request on May 28, requested a total of $173.7 billion — $156.3 billion for the Air Force and $17.4 billion for the Space Force.\\nAlthough research, development, test and evaluation costs for the Air Force increased from $26.6 billion to $28.8 billion, procurement fell from $26.1 billion to $22.9 billion.\\nThe request could be a bitter pill to swallow for Congress. It asks lawmakers to approve the retirement of dozens of aircraft — including the beloved A-10 Warthog, F-15C/D and F-16C/D fighters, KC-135 and KC-10 refueling tankers, C-130 cargo planes, and RQ-4 surveillance drones — while, in many cases, funding fewer new aircraft than anticipated in the Air Force’s FY21 plans.\\nDespite the major changes, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. C.Q. Brown has said that FY23 would host the biggest overhauls to the service.\\n“You always go into, I think, election years with a little bit different [mindset],” Brown told Defense News in November. “You probably don’t make as many big, bold moves in certain areas. And so there are some things we will take a look at as we work through [FY22]. ... And as we look at [FY23], this is where I’m really focused.”\\nAircraft divestment\\nTactical aircraft make up a huge portion of the aircraft the Air Force wants to retire in FY22, and it will not buy new fighter aircraft in numbers to make up for their loss.\\n“To attain the desired fighter fleet, the Air Force must right size current aircraft inventories to expedite the transition away from less capable, aging aircraft and emphasize investment in future capabilities” such as the F-35 Block 4 modernization program and Next Generation Air Dominance, the service’s sixth generation fighter, said Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek.\\nThe service hopes to shed 42 A-10 Warthogs, which would bring the total inventory to 239 aircraft — which puts the Air Force toward the number it believes it needs for counterterrorism and low-end operations through at least 2030, Stefanek said.\\nIt also plans to cut 47 F-16C/D and 48 F-15C/D fighters, which have “major structural issues” and will become unsafe to fly as early as 2023, Stefanek said.\\nThe Air Force is continuing the trend from FY21 of retiring a portion of its legacy tanker fleet, divesting 14 KC-10 tankers and 18 KC-135 tankers. The retirement of those aircraft will allow the Air Force to invest more money toward standing up the KC-46, specifically the transition of KC-10 and KC-135 maintainers to the KC-46, Stefanek said.\\nThe Air Force would retire a total of 13 C-130Hs, a move than Stefanek said “constitutes a low level of risk, given future joint war-fighting missions.”\\nThe service also plans to retire four of its 16 E-8 JSTARS aircraft, which are used for ground surveillance and targeting, and 20 RQ-4 Global Hawk Block 30 surveillance drones.\\n“The Air Force must accelerate investment in competitive capabilities that can penetrate and survive in the highly contested environment,” Stefanek said of the proposal. “Divestment of less-survivable weapon systems provides resources to fund emerging ISR [intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance] capabilities that can penetrate and collect data in the highly contested environment.”\\nLawmakers have already signaled they may not accept the Air Force’s plan to retire certain aircraft.\\nOn Friday morning, Arizona Sens. Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema as well as Reps Ann Kirkpatrick, Ruben Gallego, Tom O’Halleran and Greg Stanton issued a statement opposing the proposed divestment of the A-10, which is based at Davis Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona.\\n“Removing A-10s from the fleet when there is not another aircraft capable of performing this mission takes a vital tool away from our military and is the wrong step for our national security,” Kelly said.\\nThe Air Force might encounter similar opposition for retiring the RQ-4 and E-8 — something it attempted in past budgets, only to be shot down by lawmakers who have fought divesting those aircraft when no direct replacement exists.\\nCongress may be more likely to approve the retirement of KC-135s this year. In FY21, lawmakers blocked proposed divestment of KC-135s due to concerns from U.S. Transportation Command about the overall size of the tanker force. However, TRANSCOM head Gen. Stephen Lyons told lawmakers during a May 18 hearing that he would support some KC-135 retirements this year.\\nTrade-offs today for tomorrow\\nThe Air Force’s decision to slash procurement — resulting in some cases in lower buys of aircraft than was projected in FY21 — may also prove controversial.\\nThe service stuck to its plan of buying 48 F-35A conventional-takeoff-and-landing models and 12 F-15EX Eagle II fighters in FY22, at $4.5 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\\nIt also wants to spend $2.4 billion on 14 KC-46 tankers — two more than projected in its FY21 plans.\\nHowever, the service lowered procurement of the HH-60W combat rescue helicopter from 20 aircraft in its FY21 plans to 14 in the FY22 request. And instead of buying four MC-130Js for Air Force Special Operations Command, as it planned in FY21, it will buy only three at a cost of $220 million.\\nIt also funds a single C-130 and E-11 Battlefield Airborne Communications Node to replace combat losses.\\nThe service requests $2.1 billion to procure missiles. Most notably, it will buy hypersonic missiles for the first time, adding $161 million to the budget for low-rate initial production of the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon.\\nMeanwhile, the Air Force wants to make big investments in several advanced technology programs under development to outmatch emerging Chinese threats. The service stepped up its investment on Next Generation Air Dominance, a family of systems that will include a sixth-generation fighter. Spending on the program is set to increase by $623 million, for a total of $1.5 billion in FY22. An NGAD demonstrator first flew last year. Though it remains unclear when the capability will be fielded, it is set to replace the F-22.\\nAlthough the Biden administration will likely pursue a nuclear posture review, Air Force nuclear development programs received a huge boost in funding despite ongoing questions about whether to fund the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, which is meant to replace Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles. GBSD was dealt a major victory in FY22, with the Air Force adding $1.1 billion to the program for a total of $2.6 billion.\\nThe service increased spending on the Long Range Standoff Weapon from $385 million in FY21 to $609 million in FY22. Funding for the B-21 bomber stayed stable at $2.9 billion.\\nThe Air Force boosted spending on the Advanced Battle Management System program from $158 million in FY21 to $204 million in FY22. It also increased spending for hypersonic weapons prototyping from $386 million to $438 million.\\nPARIS — Two French technology companies have come together as a new entity to provide a swath of solutions for the country as it looks to master the ocean floors.\\nECA Group — which builds robotic systems, unmanned vehicles and specialized naval equipment — and iXBlue — a specialist in navigation, marine and autonomous systems — will hereafter be known collectively as Exail, the new company announced Tuesday at the biennial Euronaval trade conference in the capital.\\nThe alliance comes after ECA Group’s parent company Group Gorgé acquired iXBlue in September. The two companies were frequent partners on developing and operating autonomous systems, going back to the early 2000s, said Exail CEO Dominique Giannoni.\\nThe new name is meant to convey the notions of “excellence” and “exploration,” while hinting at the word “sail” to represent the maritime domain, Giannoni told Defense News at Exail’s trade show booth. The new company includes 1,500 people and €250 million (U.S. $245 million) in sales, he said.\\nThe respective portfolios of the former separate entities will merge, including the DriX uncrewed surface vehicle built by iXBlue and the A18D autonomous underwater vehicle developed by ECA Group.\\nThe companies saw the most synergy between their respective technologies in the naval domain, representatives said on the show floor. With their merger, Exail is now able to cover the full supply chain, from components to the completed systems.\\nWhile Giannoni did not mention any new products on the horizon, he noted the two companies are already well connected, with iXBlue inertial navigation solutions integrated on ECA Group autonomous underwater vehicle. “In the future, we will continue to develop our products while bringing our technologies together,” he said.\\niXBlue and ECA Group performed a demonstration of the collaboration between their two autonomous systems, the DriX and the A18D, during a September press tour organized by the French naval industries organization GICAN.\\nIn the harbor waters next to iXBlue’s facilities in La Ciotat, France, the two autonomous systems were deployed together and remotely operated from afar, with the A18D scanning the sea bed and gathering data, and the DriX providing live realignment to the A18D’s navigation systems, as well as faster data transmission by positioning itself above the underwater system. The DriX can simultaneously track and guide multiple assets, such as the A18D, allowing operators to remain stationed farther away on a mothership.\\nFrance has placed a sharp focus on the seabed as one of the final frontiers to defend against adversaries, who may seek to destroy critical infrastructure, with a new strategy released by the Armed Forces Ministry this year. The nation’s France 2030 plan includes €2 billion for space and seabed exploration technologies, while the proposed 2023 defense budget earmarked €3.5 million for the seabed domain.\\nThe seabed strategy released in February calls for technologies that can allow the Navy to explore the seabed down to 6,000 meters. ECA Group developed the Ulyx autonomous underwater vehicle that can reach those depths, the company said.\\nWhile there is no program of record, Exail is in discussions with the Navy regarding such technologies, Giannoni said.\\nECA Group is a partner on the Belgian-Dutch rMCM mine countermeasures program, in a temporary joint venture with Naval Group under the name Belgian Robotics and Defense. Exail will continue that work, along with all other programs that iXBlue and ECA Group took part in, a representative confirmed to Defense News. On Tuesday at Euronaval, leaders from the three nations’ defense ministries announced they would collaborate on future mine countermeasure technology efforts.\\nCOLOGNE, Germany — The Belgian Defence Ministry has awarded a contract worth nearly €2 billion (U.S. $2.2 billion) to a consortium led by France’s Naval Group to deliver mine-hunting ships and drones to the navies of Belgium and the Netherlands, according to the shipbuilder.\\nThe announcement on Wednesday came after the customary review period by the Belgian legislature had passed. Beligum announced in March that it planned to select Belgium Naval and Robotics, a joint venture of Naval Group and ECA Group, to produce 12 vessels equipped with about 100 drones for the two countries. Six vessels will go to Belgium, and the other six to the Dutch.\\nFinding and disabling sea mines is a key mission for the two neighboring countries. Their navies are configured mainly to defend territorial waters and the nearby English Channel, which allows passage to the North Sea.\\nThe offer by Naval Group and ECA Group leans heavily on undersea drones to deal with the treacherous weapons. The ships will be built to launch and recover the ECA Group’s “Inspector 125” unmanned boats, which carry various autonomous underwater drones for finding mines and setting them off from a safe distance.\\nThe contract is expected to last 10 years, according to a consortium statement. An initial three-year development phase is to be followed by a production stage, putting the first system in the water by 2024.\\nThe two companies hope the high-profile deal will generate additional sales elsewhere in the world. “The Belgian and Dutch navies being a reference in mine warfare within NATO, the choice of our consortium is a major asset for export,” a statement reads.\\nSTUTTGART, Germany — Spanish and German missile manufacturers are leading an effort to develop a new hypersonic defense interceptor as part of the European Defence Fund’s initial batch of sponsored projects.\\nIn July, the European Union announced the awardees of its first slate of EDF-funded projects, which included 61 research-and-development projects and over 1.2 billion (U.S. $1.23 billion) in government funds.\\nAmong the higher awards is the European Hypersonic Defence Interceptor (EU HYDEF) program, which will cover the concept phase to develop an endo-atmospheric interceptor, according to European Defence Fund documents. The program will run for 36 months and is expected to cost nearly €110 million ($110.2 million). The EU will contribute a maximum of almost €100 million to the effort.\\nSpain’s Sener Aerospacial Sociedad Anonima is coordinating the EU HYDEF program, while Germany’s Diehl Defence is serving as the overall technical lead, company officials said.\\nThe goal is to build a “European interceptor targeting the 2035+ threats, along with weapon and sensor systems,” per the EU fact sheet. Sener, Diehl, and their partners will work to develop and demonstrate the HYDEF interceptor.\\nAt this point, the EU HYDEF program remains in a negotiation phase with the European Commission and participating member states, said Fernando Quintana, Sener’s weapon systems director. Those negotiations will eventually lead to a grant agreement to transfer the pre-allocated funds to the industry team, he told Defense News. The program management body remains to be determined, he added – either the European Commission itself would oversee the effort, or else the intergovernmental Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR).\\nThe project is related to the an effort dubbed Timely Warning and Interception with Space-based TheatER surveillance, or TWISTER, running under the banner of the PESCO program, short for Permanent Structured Cooperation.\\nThe end goal of the interceptor program is to field a countermeasure that could eventually be integrated into an air defense system of systems capable of early warning, tracking, and interception of high-performance airborne threats, including ballistic missile defense (BMD) and hypersonic vehicles. “This system of systems is precisely what several European countries, including Spain, under the leadership of France, are developing in TWISTER,” Quintana noted.\\nA European Commission official declined to comment on specific EDF projects, citing ongoing grant agreement negotiations, but stated that while the commission does not itself link EDF proposals to existing PESCO projects, EDF applicants can choose to refer to a specific PESCO effort in their research or development process.\\nIn addition to overall coordination, Sener will lead elements of the work related to guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems, along with communications, and actuators and aerodynamic control, Quintana said. Its work on EU HYDEF will be informed by its involvement in the European Space Agency’s (ESA) forthcoming controlled space re-entry vehicle, the Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV), and the agency’s future “Space Rider” uncrewed orbital spaceplane. Both of those vehicles will reach hypersonic speeds during re-entry, Quintana noted. Sener also provides the actuation and control subsystems for MBDA’s METEOR air-to-air missile and Diehl’s IRIS-T interceptor.\\nSener and Diehl have long had a “close industrial relationship,” working on both the air-to-air and surface-launched medium range (SLM) IRIS-T variants, Quintana said. “The success of this air defense missile, and the experience gained by the companies in its development, was the basis for both Sener and Diehl to consider the opportunity to jointly develop a much higher performance missile, such as the one proposed in EU HYDEF,” he said.\\nMeanwhile, Diehl is responsible for coordinating the “system of systems” component, as well as the interceptor systems’ engineering and design, Sinikka Salchow, company lead for the EU HYDEF program, told Defense News. Diehl is also responsible for upstage design and system simulation, as well as upstage guidance, navigation and control, Salchow said in an email. The missile components seeker and signal electronics will likewise fall under the German company’s purview.\\nThe company will apply its experience from the IRIS-T SLM interceptor as well as from Raytheon’s Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Block 2B program to the EU HYDEF project, particularly related to multimode and multispectral seeker technology. Diehl Defence has more than 18 years of experience in the R&D field on hypersonic technologies, as well as on ballistic missile defense projects, Salchow noted.\\nEleven additional partners are part of the EU HYDEF consortium. They include: Spain’s Navantia; Escribano Mechanical and Engineering, GMV Aerospace and Defence, Instalaza S.A., and the Ministry of Defence’s Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial Esteban Terradas; Poland’s Instytut Techniczny Wojsk Lotniczych and Warsaw Institute of Aviation; Czech Republic’s L.K. Engineering; Norway’s Nammo; Sweden’s Ruag Space; and Belgium’s Sonaca Group.\\nWASHINGTON — General Electric Aviation on Monday said it and the U.S. Air Force finished testing the firm’s second adaptive engine, which it hopes the military will adopt for the F-35 jet, and is ready to move into the engineering and manufacturing development phase.\\nIn March, GE began testing the prototype XA100 — its offering for the military’s Adaptive Engine Transition Program — at the Arnold Engineering Development Complex on Arnold Air Force Base in Tennessee. This was the second phase of testing for the engine, GE said, and was meant to more closely replicate flight conditions and more precisely measure results than the first phase of tests at GE’s Evendale, Ohio, facility in 2021.\\nGE said in a release Monday that the completion of testing at the Arnold facility marks the final major milestone of the AETP contract it won in June 2016.\\nWASHINGTON — A fire broke out Thursday night in the amphibious assault ship Bougainville, which is still under construction at Ingalls Shipbuilding, the company confirmed, with several shipyard employees being treated for smoke inhalation.\\nIngalls Shipbuilding fire and safety personnel responded to a call for a fire in the Bougainville superstructure, or the portion that rises above the flight deck level.\\n“The fire was extinguished and two shipbuilders were transported to the hospital for smoke inhalation and were released later in the evening. Four other shipbuilders were treated for smoke inhalation onsite. No additional injuries have been reported,” Kimberly Aguillard, an Ingalls Shipbuilding spokeswoman, told Defense News. “Our shipbuilders responded immediately and within a short amount of time the fire was extinguished. A full review of the events, including a detailed timeline, is under development.”\\nThe cause of the fire remains under investigation, but initial findings indicate hot work was being performed nearby. Hot work can create sparks that can, as has been the case in previous shipboard fires, ignite flammable materials like rags, papers and oils.\\nAguillard said the fire and smoke was contained to a small number of compartments.\\n“Initial indications are that damage is limited to the immediately impacted compartments and no damage to the remainder of the ship nor the shipyard was incurred,” she added.\\nBougainville is the third America-class amphibious assault ship. Construction began in October 2018, and the ship is scheduled to launch from its land-based construction area into the water later this year. The ship was originally expected to deliver to the U.S. Navy in fiscal 2024, but service budget documents now show an October 2025 delivery date.\\nIngalls Shipbuilding is a subsidiary of HII, which was ranked as the 17th largest defense company in the world in the Defense News Top 100, based on defense revenue.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Army is launching a phase for the concept design of its future Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, which is intended to replace the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle.\\nThe service held a virtual industry day Dec. 9 for the $4.6 billion and plans to release a request for proposals to move into the design phase by the end of the month, according to a Dec. 9 Army statement issued following the completion of the industry event.\\nSince the service bungled its original attempt to hold a competition for the OMFV program, the Army has reconfigured the effort into one that lets industry dictate much of what is in the realm of the possible.\\nThe Army’s first attempt laid out threshold requirements on a timeline that many in industry did not see as feasible or worth the investment. BAE Systems, which manufactures the Bradley, for instance, decided not to enter. And when only one physical bid sample from General Dynamics Land Systems was turned in by the deadline, the Army went back to the drawing board and came up with a different competitive plan with more flexibility.\\nInstead of a laundry list of requirements that, when paired together, became unachievable in the timeline, the Army laid out nine characteristics to help shape designs.\\nThe Army plans to request whitepapers and then choose five prime contractor teams to design rough digital prototypes. The service will then award up to three contracts for a detailed design and prototype phase that will include options for low-rate initial production. One vendor will be selected to go into production.\\nFollowing the release of a draft request for proposals in July, the Army has taken into account a wealth of industry feedback and incorporated it into its plans for the upcoming phase of competition.\\nThe service plans to spend $4.6 billion from fiscal 2022 through FY26 on OMFV so it is turning to industry input earlier and more than ever.\\n“As we enter Phase 2, the Concept Design phase, for OMFV, inclusive feedback and innovative thinking from industry remains key,” Brig. Gen. Glenn Dean, the new program executive officer for Ground Combat Systems, said in the Army statement. “We received tremendous feedback from Industry on the draft RFP released in July, and we have made significant changes as a result of that feedback.”\\nThe RFP for the concept design phase “reflects a reduction in scope and deliverables commensurate [with] the maturity of requirements at the outset, and lays the foundation for subsequent phases with respect to open architecture and modern engineering practices,” Dean said.\\nThe new approach “is novel in the way it maximizes industry innovation while also reducing the burden and cost to industry for participation,” the Army statement notes.\\nIndustry will develop digital designs as requirements mature and before prototypes are built, according to the Army. The designs will also inform the Abbreviated-Concept Development Document (A-CDD) expected to be published in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\\n“The A-CDD allows us to make future decisions on the design without overly constricting vendor efforts to innovate,” Brig. Gen. Ross Coffman, who is in charge of Next-Generation Combat Vehicle efforts, said in the statement.\\nFollowing the concept design phase, the Army will move into a detailed design phase that will be executed over the course of FY23 and FY24. The entire program will consist of five phases that include designing, prototyping, testing and producing an OMFV.\\nThe prototyping phase will begin in fiscal year 25, according to slides presented at the OMFV industry day. Vehicle testing will begin in FY26 and wrap up in FY27 with a production decision planned for the fourth quarter of FY27. Full-rate production is expected to begin in the second quarter of FY30.\\nIn parallel to the concept design phase, the Army will develop an open architecture for OMFV.\\nAn open architecture has risen to the top of the OMFV planner’s list of required capability, particularly after seeing the need to be networked with other capabilities across the battlefield and at the forward edge at Project Convergence at Yuma Proving Grounds, Arizona, over the summer.\\nThe Army will establish a voluntary consortium beginning in January 2021 that will represent industry, government and academia, in order to develop such an open architecture, according to the statement.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Army has picked six companies that will develop ways to power electric vehicles in austere, remote locations, according to an April 22 statement from Army Futures Command.\\nThe effort will support the Army’s Next-Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) modernization effort and the Ground Vehicles Systems Center — in collaboration with the Army Applications Laboratory and Alion Science and Technology — as the service tackles how to power a future fleet of roughly 225,000 electric vehicles while operating in a field where infrastructure for such capability would likely not exist.\\nThe Power Transfer Cohort began virtually on March 29 and concept design presentations to NGCV leadership are expected May 20. Cohort companies each received $100,000 to complete the 8-week program.\\n“Sourced from across the country, the selected companies represent a range of technologies and expertise — all aimed at identifying and exploring technologies that will help power the Army’s move to electric vehicles (EVs) and allow the Army to use electric power in remote locations,” the release states.\\nThe companies chosen are Royal Oak, Michigan-based Coritech Services, Inc.; Czero, Inc. based in Fort Collins, Colorado; Fermata Energy in Charlottesville, Virginia; West Lafayette, Indiana-based PC Krause and Associates; Tritium Technologies, LLC in Torrance, California and Albany, New York-based Wright Electric.\\nCoritech specializes in “custom solutions for applications that require electrical control systems to meet unique process requirements or to demonstrate viability of early technology concepts,” the release said.\\nCzero is a mechanical engineering company focused on “early-stage research and development of technologies that reduce energy consumption and harmful emissions,” the statement read.\\nFermata designs, provides and uses patented technology that speeds up the adoption of electric vehicles and the transition to renewable energy and clean transportation, according to the release.\\nPC Krause provides engineering services, software tools, modeling and simulations facilities as well as hardware prototyping and design with a specialty in integrated power, thermal and propulsion systems on mobile platforms, the release noted.\\nTritium develops proprietary technology to make “advanced and reliable” DC fast chargers for electric vehicles. The company was the first in the world to “implement” Plug and Charge, which “enables EVs and charging equipment to communicate, authenticate and transact seamlessly via the charging cable,” the release stated.\\nWright is comprised of a team of aerospace engineers, powertrain experts and battery chemists and is an industry leader in “the future of sustainable, lower-emissions air travel,” and is building electric planes to lower carbon emissions, fuel costs, noise and runway takeoff time, the release noted.\\nThe Army is making a push to power its brigades using electric and hybrid sources as a way to break free from fuel and disposable batteries that bog down its logistics tail and limit mobility and reach.\\nLt. Gen. Eric Wesley, then-director of the Futures and Concepts Center within Army Futures Command, told Defense News early last year that it’s one thing to power a vehicle electrically, but another to work out an entire enterprise that would support fleets of electric vehicles and other capabilities.\\n“Let’s be clear. We’re behind. We’re late to meet on this thing,” Wesley said. “If you look at all of the analysis, all of the various nations that we work with, they’re all going to electric power with their automotive fleet, and right now, although we do [science and technology] and we’ve got some research and development going on and we can build prototypes, in terms of a transition plan, we are not there.”\\nThe AAL cohort program is just one way the Army is looking to make progress on this front.\\nLast fall, AFC gave the Maneuver Capabilities Development and Integration Directorate the green light to develop a plan to equip tactical and combat vehicles with electric power. The directorate is in the process of drafting a requirements document for Tactical and Combat Vehicle Electrification.\\nThe Power Transfer Cohort is one of several cohorts the AAL is supporting. The first ever cohort was set up last year to focus on the Army’s Field Artillery Autonomous Resupply (FAAR) effort, which is helping to solve handling artillery through automation across the logistics chain. Another cohort — Fire Faster — was established later in the year to come up with solutions to increase the rate of fire and smooth out the process of loading artillery pieces\\n“Last year, we launched and validated this new Cohort Program approach. We know it works, and we’re already seeing the results for our Army mission partners,” Col. Len Rosanoff, director of AAL, said in the statement. “The Power Transfer Cohort is a chance to show that this model can scale across the Army to solve other complex problems. This approach will make the Army a better business partner for industry. And we want others in the Army to know they can do this, too.”\\nWASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin on Friday announced it halted acceptance flights and deliveries of new F-35 Joint Strike Fighters amid an investigation into the cause of an F-35B mishap on a Texas runway this month.\\nThe halt means Lockheed delivered fewer F-35s than the 148 contractually required in 2022.\\n“We were on track to meet our delivery commitment” before the F-35B mishap on Dec. 15, Lockheed spokeswoman Laura Siebert told Defense News. “However, given the delivery pause, we delivered 141 aircraft” this year.\\nThe Pentagon and Lockheed Martin also announced Friday they finalized a contract worth up to $30 billion to deliver up to 398 F-35s for U.S. and international customers over the program’s next three lots, from lots 15 through 17. However, the contract only guarantees lots 15 and 16, with an option for lot 17.\\nThe contract will also include the first F-35s for Belgium, Finland and Poland, Lockheed said in a release.\\nSiebert said Lockheed halted acceptance flights after the Dec. 15 mishap “out of an abundance of caution.” And because those flights must happen before the delivery of newly built F-35s, it had the effect of halting deliveries as well.\\nLockheed has since continued to build new F-35s at Air Force Plant 4 in Fort Worth, Texas, the main facility for building the fifth-generation fighters. But through the latter half of December, those newly completed F-35s stayed on the ground.\\nSiebert said nine new F-35s are now awaiting acceptance flights and deliveries.\\nVideo of the Dec. 15 mishap, which went viral on social media, showed the F-35B hovering not far above the ground before descending, bouncing once and tipping forward. Its nose and wing touch the ground, and it starts to spin around. The pilot safely ejected.\\nThis was a newly constructed F-35B that had not been transferred to the U.S. government. The pilot is in the Air Force and was performing quality checks for the Defense Contract Management Agency at the time.\\nNaval Air Systems Command is still investigating the mishap, with the support of the F-35 Joint Program Office. But earlier this week, the JPO issued guidance as a result of the incident for a small number of newer F-35s it felt are at higher risk.\\nIn a Tuesday statement to Defense News, the JPO said it “has issued a Time Compliance Technical Directive (TCTD) to restrict some aircraft, which have been evaluated to be of higher risk, from flight operations while the investigation into the mishap on December 15 continues and until procedures can be developed for their return to flight.”\\nThe JPO would not say how many fighters were grounded.\\nA source familiar with the program told Defense News the investigation into the Dec. 15 mishap found that a tube used to transfer high-pressure fuel in the fighter’s F135 engine, made by Pratt & Whitney, had failed. This discovery prompted the JPO to update its safety risk assessments, which affected jets with fewer than 40 hours of flying.\\nPratt & Whitney declined to comment to Defense News on the Dec. 15 mishap because it involves an ongoing investigation.\\nThe latest contract for F-35s could include more fighters than the Pentagon originally estimated. When the handshake agreement was announced in July, William LaPlante, the Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer, said the deal was for about 375 aircraft.\\nBut the maximum order of 398 fighters Lockheed Martin will now build — 145 in lot 15, 127 in lot 16 and an option to build up to 126 in lot 17 — is still 80 fewer than those included in the previous $34 billion contract for lots 12 through 14, signed in 2019.\\nWASHINGTON — The Pentagon is abandoning its efforts to develop a next-generation adaptive engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, according to Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall.\\nInstead, Kendall said during a March 10 briefing on the fiscal 2024 budget, the military will stick with and upgrade the F-35’s current engine — a major win for F135 maker Pratt & Whitney.\\nThe decision means the military will not move forward with its Adaptive Engine Transition Program, an effort to fund research, development, prototyping and testing of a new kind of engine with enhanced thrust, power and cooling ability, The adaptive engine uses three streams of air to cool the engine and the jet, and has an adaptive cycle that allows it to adjust to the configuration that provides the most thrust and efficiency for a given situation.\\nBoth General Electric Aviation and Pratt & Whitney had designed new engines as part of AETP, but only GE had pitched its engine — the XA100 — as a replacement for the F-35.\\nMilitary officials said Friday they determined Pratt & Whitney’s proposal to modernize the already existing F135s in a program called the Engine Core Upgrade was the most cost-efficient option that would work for all F-35s.\\n“We were not able to fund the AETP program,” Kendall said. He told reporters the cost of GE’s XA100 adaptive engine and doubts it would work in all versions of the F-35 led the military to stick with the F135.\\n“We needed something that was affordable, and would support all the variants” of the F-35, he added.\\nAn Air Force spokesperson said Tuesday the service plans to spend $245 million on the Engine Core Upgrade in 2024.\\nThe Air Force also said Tuesday it has obligated nearly $2.7 billion for AETP since the program launched in 2016.\\nIn a statement provided to Defense News, a GE spokesperson expressed the company’s displeasure with the Pentagon’s decision.\\n“This budget fails to consider rising geopolitical tensions and the need for revolutionary capabilities that only the XA100 engine can provide by 2028,” the GE spokesperson said. “Nearly 50 bipartisan members of Congress wrote in support of advanced engine programs like ours because they recognize these needs, in addition to the role competition can play in reducing past cost overruns. The XA100 engine is ready to power U.S. warfighters today and in the future.”\\nThe GE spokesman said in a follow-up email that the company plans to keep working on the XA100 this year as it moves into the design and manufacturing advancement phase. The Air Force awarded GE a contract Dec. 27 worth up to $203 million to keep maturing its AETP design.\\nPratt & Whitney applauded the military’s decision to fund its Engine Core Upgrade in its own statement.\\n“All F-35 variants need fully-enabled Block 4 capabilities as soon as possible, and with this funding, we can deliver upgraded engines starting in 2028,” Jill Albertelli, president of military engines at Pratt & Whitney, said in the statement. “The F135 ECU saves billions, which ensures a record quantity of F-35s can be procured. It also ensures funding will be available to develop 6th generation propulsion for the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance Platform.”\\nPentagon officials have repeatedly said that as the F-35 receives more upgrades and additional capabilities — particularly with its upcoming Block 4 modernization — it will need more power and cooling than the current F135 engine can provide.\\nGE officials said the company’s XA100 engine would use advanced composites and new technologies such as a third stream of air to produce better fuel efficiency, thrust, speed, range and heat management.\\nBut the XA100 would have proven costly. Kendall last year warned outfitting the F-35 with an adaptive engine could cost more than $6 billion, which he said would force the military to buy roughly 70 fewer fighters.\\nKendall also noted the military had serious doubts about GE’s ability to make its adaptive engine work in the F-35B, the Marine Corps variant.\\n“The Air Force, with the A variant, was the only service that was really seriously interested in AETP, for which it was a really good fit,” Kendall said. “There was some discussion about whether it could be made to go in the [Navy and Marine Corps’ carrier-based] C variant. But the Marine Corps variant was going to be very, very difficult, if not impossible.”\\nDave Tweedie, vice president and general manager for advanced products at GE Edison Works, said in a Feb. 16 call with reporters the company had found a way to adapt its XA100 into the F-35B.\\nUpdate: This story was updated June 2 with additional information from the F-35 Joint Program Office.\\nWASHINGTON — The F-35 program only knows how much cooling the Joint Strike Fighter’s engine will need through 2035, government auditors said in a new report.\\nBut that’s a few years after the F-35 program needs to finish upgrading its thermal management system to be able to support rapidly arriving new capabilities, the Government Accountability Office said in a Tuesday report.\\nEditor’s note: This story was updated with information on the Office of Inspector General’s evaluation of the program.\\nNATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — The U.S. Air Force’s secretive, next-generation fighter platform is still in the design process and has not formally entered its engineering, manufacturing and development stage, the service’s secretary said this month.\\nThe acknowledgment marks a step back from June, when Frank Kendall publicly said the highly classified Next Generation Air Dominance program had already hit the key milestone. “We have now started on the EMD program to do the development aircraft that we’re going to take into production,” he said during a Heritage Foundation event at the time.\\nIt also has some experts wondering if the service can meet its goal of delivering the first iterations of the sixth-generation fighter by the end of this decade.\\nKendall offered the fullest update so far on the status of NGAD during a Sept. 19 roundtable with reporters at the Air and Space Forces Association’s Air, Space and Cyber conference.\\nThe service is still designing NGAD, Kendall said, and the program has not yet gone through the Milestone B review process. That milestone marks the completion of a program’s technology maturation phase and the formal start of an acquisition program, when the service takes its preliminary design and focuses on system integration, manufacturing processes and other details ahead of production.\\nKendall’s June comments, in which he also said the Air Force would deliver some NGAD capabilities by the end of the decade, surprised some in the aviation world and suggested the program was further along in the process than initially thought. Several defense publications, including Defense News, reported on his comments at the time as indicating NGAD had formally entered the EMD phase.\\nAsked about his June comments during the Defense News Conference on Sept. 7, Kendall suggested he hadn’t meant the implication.\\n“I’m an old-school guy,” Kendall said. “I’ve been around doing this stuff for a long time, and I still think of engineering and manufacturing development as a phase in which you are working on the new design.”\\nAsked again about the program at the Air, Space and Cyber conference, Kendall clarified that the service is still working on NGAD’s design and that he used the term EMD in “my colloquial sense.” He said the Milestone B decision, which occurs after the preliminary design review and is a prerequisite for entering the EMD phase, has not taken place.\\nKendall also said the Air Force is still aiming for production of NGAD around the end of the decade.\\nAir Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter said this month that the end of this decade is the service’s goal for “fielding the manned platform” component of NGAD. Its drone wingmen, which the Air Force now refers to as collaborative combat aircraft, are expected to arrive sooner, he added.\\nKendall’s acknowledgment that NGAD has not entered the EMD phase, much less finished the design process, raises the possibility the program might not reach initial operating capability by the end of the decade, Heritage Foundation think tank fellow and former Air Force fighter pilot John Venable told Defense News.\\n“It could happen [by 2030], but the odds are against it happening” by then, he said.\\nHeather Penney, a former F-16 pilot and senior resident fellow at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, is also wary the Air Force can achieve its goal by the end of the decade.\\n“I have serious skepticism that NGAD will reach a meaningful full-rate production Milestone C decision by the end of the decade,” Penney said. “It would be realistic to expect that full-rate production will not occur until sometime into the 2030s. I would love for the Air Force to prove this wrong.”\\nThe Milestone C decision comes at the end of the EMD phase of the acquisition process, and it is where a decision is made whether or not to move a program into the production and deployment phase.\\nKendall’s comments have also attracted the attention of the Pentagon’s inspector general.\\nIn a Sept. 26 letter to Heidi Shyu, the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, the Office of Inspector General said it plans to begin an evaluation of NGAD this month. The office wants to see to what extent the Air Force had demonstrated the program’s critical technologies were mature enough to warrant moving to the EMD phase.\\nDuring his June comments, Kendall said the average Air Force acquisition program takes a little less than seven years to move from starting the EMD phase to initial operating capability. Later, at the Air, Space and Cyber conference, he suggested NGAD might be able to compress that timeline. “I’m not sure NGAD will be an average program,” he told reporters.\\nKendall has said he is pushing Air Force acquisition officials to get new capabilities, such as NGAD’s autonomous drone wingmen, into the field faster than the process normally allows. For example, Kendall said he isn’t interested in conducting demonstrations or experiments unless absolutely necessary.\\n“If we don’t need it to reduce risk, we should go right to development for production and get there as quickly as we can,” he said in June. “If the risk is high, and we need to do some things just to be prudent, to address that risk first, we should do that in a focused, efficient way. I have a sense of urgency about getting new capabilities [and] I’m willing to take some risk there.”\\nWhile Venable and Penney cautioned there’s a lack of public information on NGAD, they said the program still has multiple headwinds.\\nThe Air Force wants it to have an autonomous drone wingman capability, include sixth-generation technology and exist as a “family of systems” rather than just a single manned aircraft. It will also be expensive, costing hundreds of millions of dollars apiece, Kendall told lawmakers earlier this year.\\nBecause the program hasn’t entered the EMD phase, passed the Milestone B review or finished its design, Venable said the Air Force will have to significantly compress its seven-year timeline to meet the 2030 goal.\\n“You could call me a skeptic, [but] there is no track record that says they can do that,” Venable said. “If you’re going to buy all commercial off-the-shelf stuff, [that can be done]. This is one where it’s leading-edge technology.”\\nHe and Penney agreed the Air Force might not reach initial operating capability for NGAD until well into the 2030s.\\n“This is clearly going to be an advanced capability,” Penney said. “Because of the classification, there’s a lot that we don’t know about it — everything from design materials to production to capabilities.”\\nIt’s also uncertain how the different capabilities comprising the “family of systems” will combine to make up the NGAD platform, Penney said — and this will require considerable testing.\\n“It’s probably not just one airplane; it’s probably several,” Penney said. “And we’ll need to prove that NGAD can connect and communicate with other capabilities, whether or not those are within other domains, or whether or not it’s within its own formation.”\\nWith the Air Force moving to retire older airframes, such as noncombat-capable F-22 jets, and shift some of the savings to NGAD, Venable is worried the service may be making a risky bet that NGAD arrives by the end of the decade.\\n“If it does not happen, and this slides into the next decade — which is more likely than not — it would be a fool’s errand to actually cash in viable combat platforms now on the bet that no Las Vegas gambler would take,” Venable said.\\nAlthough Kendall would not discuss NGAD’s capabilities, he remains adamant the program is vital for the Air Force to keep up with advanced competitors, particularly China.\\nAsked at the Defense News Conference if the nation can afford an air platform costing multiple hundreds of millions of dollars apiece — several times the price tag of an F-35 fighter — Kendall responded: “Can the nation afford not to have air superiority? We have to have air superiority.”\\nWASHINGTON — House Armed Services Tactical Air and Land Subcommittee lawmakers want the U.S. Army to establish and run a pilot program examining how electric tactical vehicles might operate in the field.\\nIn the Army’s climate strategy released earlier this year, the service laid out a goal to field hybrid electric tactical vehicles by 2035 and all-electric vehicles by 2050. But with that pledge comes a complicated logistics tail for maintaining and recharging them on the battlefield.\\nThe Army also approved a tactical and combat vehicle electrification, or TaCV-E, initial capabilities document in December 2021 that “informs the transition to advancing electrification capabilities and operational requirements generation for the ground vehicles fleet,” according to the subcommittee’s fiscal 2023 authorization mark.\\nThe subcommittee members are “interested if electrification in the near term is achievable for tactical ground vehicles given the evident operational benefits associated with reduced vehicle thermal and noise signature, increased dash speed and reduction in liquid fuel requirements.”\\nBy prototyping and experimenting with TaCV-E, the military could gain a better understanding of what is needed to operate and to inform planning and potential issues, the mark states.\\nThe subcommittee said there is “considerable and apparent” value for the service to enter into Cooperative Research and Development Agreements, also known as CRADAs, with industry partners.\\nAnd the Army should establish a pilot program at one of the combat training centers, like the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, to experiment and demonstrate “integrated electrification capabilities” to include electric vehicles, mobile fleet charging systems and exportable power generation during operational training exercises, the subcommittee suggests.\\nShould the language make it into the final FY23 authorization bill, the Army secretary would be required to provide by Jan. 15 a report to the HASC on whether a pilot program would be feasible and what the effort would cost.\\nAs Defense News first reported, the Army is preparing its first-ever operational energy strategy, which is expected by the end of the year. In the strategy, the Army would map out how it manages and distributes power in operations across the battlefield.\\nThe Army is already working with industry in a number of ways, including assessing capabilities at exercises stateside such as the Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment.\\nThe service is assessing the possibility of fielding a hybrid electric version of several of its vehicles, including the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle and the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle.\\nOshkosh, the JLTV’s manufacturer, unveiled earlier this yea, a hybrid version of the vehicle, but the Army does not have a stated requirement for the capability yet. And the service plans in FY23 to decide whether it will pursue a hybrid Bradley.\\nThe most likely candidate to become an all-electric tactical vehicle is the Electric Light Reconnaissance Vehicle. The Army has looked at a variety of options through demonstrations, but has yet to fund the effort.\\nLast year, Army Futures Command’s Applications Laboratory picked companies to participate in a cohort to develop ways to power electric vehicles in austere, remote locations.\\nA separate mark of the FY23 authorization bill would require the Pentagon to set up a pilot program for transitioning entire non-tactical vehicle fleets at certain installations to electric power.\\nThe HASC’s readiness subcommittee wants the secretary of each military department to select an installation for the pilot and submit a plan to make all non-tactical vehicles at that location electric-powered by 2025.\\nLONDON — Britain plans to boost its undersea capabilities in the face of growing threats from Russia, with the Ministry of Defence preparing to release tender documents in the next few weeks aimed at purchasing a deep-water remotely operated vehicle.\\nThe Defence Equipment and Support arm of the MoD is currently in the process acquiring the remotely operating vehicle in a program likely to cost the British £20 million, or $24 million.\\nThe commercial off-the-shelf vehicle, being acquired via a competitive tender, will give the British the ability to manipulate objects and produce high resolution imagery down to a depth of 6,000 meters.\\nThe requirement to provide Britain with a deep-water salvage capability was included in a recently published update of the departments forward equipment pipeline of work.\\nAn MoD spokesperson confirmed the procurement effort is underway.\\n“We are seeking to procure a remotely operated vehicle system, which will provide a deep-water salvage capability in support of United Kingdom maritime operations,” they said.\\nNews the British are strengthening their military underwater capabilities comes just days after Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced the MoD was speeding up a multirole ocean surveillance vessel program using some of the cash from scrapping a controversial plan to build a £250 million ($297 million) super yacht to promote British exports around the globe.\\nWallace said instead the MoD would be speeding up the introduction of a specialist multi-role ocean surveillance ship being acquired to protect underwater pipelines and cables from potential sabotage by Russia.\\nThe first ocean surveillance vessel, thought to be a converted merchant ship, should be handed over to the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, the support arm of the Royal Navy, next year, months ahead of the original plan.\\nA second ship , likely built locally, is also now part of the British plan to protect undersea infrastructure from possible attack.\\nOriginally the government had planned just one vessel when the requirement was included in the 2021 integrated defense and security review – which is itself subject to review expected to be published by January.\\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on Nov. 7 Wallace told lawmakers he was prioritizing the procurement of the surveillance ship and had terminated the competition to build the yacht, which the MoD was to fund.\\n“In the face of the Russian illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and Putin’s reckless disregard of international arrangements designed to keep world order, it is right that we prioritize delivering capabilities which safeguard our national infrastructure,” he told members of Parliament.\\nThe Russians are thought to be behind the late September sabotage of two Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea bringing natural gas from Russia to western Europe.\\nIt’s not clear at this point whether the deep-sea unmanned vehicle will be part of the surveillance vessel capability.\\nThe Royal Navy has previously said the ship will be fitted with advanced sensors and a number of remotely operated and autonomous undersea drones.\\nThe envisioned vehicle is likely to be able to interface onto a number of platforms both commercial and government-owned.\\nCorrection: This story has been updated to remove a reference to a provision that was not included in the final bill.\\nWASHINGTON — A new compromise version of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2022 would allow the Air Force to retire most of the aircraft it sought to downsize — but not the A-10 Thunderbolt II.\\nIf signed into law, this version of the NDAA would deliver another defeat for the Air Force’s efforts to retire the Warthog. The proposed bill includes a Senate provision blocking the Air Force from retiring or otherwise mothballing any A-10s in 2022, except for those that have suffered a significant mishap and are no longer mission-capable.\\nThis version of the bill, negotiated between Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate armed services committees, was introduced on Tuesday. It could see a vote in the House as soon as Tuesday night, and from there, the Senate is expected to take it up this week.\\nThe Air Force has long sought to retire A-10s so it can free up more money and resources to modernize and focus on capabilities that can better hold up in a high-end fight against an advanced adversary such as China or Russia, but the move repeatedly encountered pushback from lawmakers.\\nAir Force Secretary Frank Kendall, speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum on Saturday, specifically mentioned the Warthog as an example of an aging plane that should be retired to allow the service to focus more on China. He called the old iron in the service’s fleet “an anchor holding back the Air Force.”\\nThe NDAA also would require the Air Force to report by March on the status of re-winging A-10s and the timeline for finishing them.\\nIt would also allow the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps to procure 85 F-35 fighters, as well as increase funding to improve their maintenance and bring down sustainment costs.\\nBut later this decade, the NDAA could impose limits on the number of F-35s the military could acquire in an attempt to rein in rising costs of sustaining the Joint Strike Fighter fleet.\\nThe NDAA would restrict how many F-35s each services could have beginning in 2028 if they don’t meet affordability targets. The bill would set a formula lowering the F-35 inventory if its actual cost-per-tail exceed the set goal in fiscal 2027. The Air Force aims to eventually have 1,763 F-35As, the Marine Corps would have an inventory of 353 F-35Bs and 67 F-35Cs, and the Navy would have 273 F-35Cs.\\nThe provision has been watered down from its original proposal earlier this year, which would have put a 2026 deadline in place. It also would allow the defense secretary to waive the limits on a particular F-35 model if more of those fighters were needed to meet a combatant commander’s strategic needs.\\nThe NDAA would also prevent the defense secretary from entering a performance-based logistics sustainment contract for the F-35 or its engine, until the department can certify that the contract would either reduce costs or increase readiness or availability.\\nThe NDAA would also require the Air Force and the joint chiefs to tell lawmakers more about the Air Force’s future plans for its aerial refueling aircraft. The proposed NDAA calls for more information on what the requirements for the proposed bridge tanker — also known as the KC-Y — would be, its acquisition strategy and how much it might cost. Lawmakers also want to see the plan for developing a follow-on advanced tanker, or the KC-Z.\\nThe NDAA would also allow the Air Force to retire 14 KC-10 Extenders in 2022 and another 12 in 2023, as well as 18 KC-135 Stratotankers.\\nAnd it would require the defense secretary to issue a report on sustainment costs for all fighter aircraft and spell out what the Defense Department plans to do to cut those costs.\\nThe NDAA would also provide additional money for the Air Force to buy five more F-15EX fighters, which are currently unfunded, as well as funds to modernize the E-8 JSTARS aircraft and for engines for the upcoming EC-37B Compass Call.\\nAnd it would fund the Air Force’s efforts to continue developing the T-7A Red Hawk trainer aircraft and for the Air Force and Navy’s Next Generation Air Dominance programs.\\nThe Navy would get funding to buy 12 F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters. And the bill would pay for four Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drones and one MQ-1 Gray Eagle for the Army.\\nHELSINKI — Nordic governments are exploring a number of joint initiatives to support Ukraine’s defense against Russia, including proposals for shared weapons buys, coordinating arms donations and expanding logistics cooperation to safely transport military equipment to the war-torn country.\\nThe discussions emanate from a meeting of Nordic defense ministers in November that was hosted by Finland in Helsinki. The meeting, which focused on deepening pan-Nordic defense collaboration against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, examined the potential for greater linkage of the four countries in support of Kyiv.\\nThe ongoing government-level talks are taking place as all four Nordic states, including NATO applicants Finland and Sweden, individually plan to increase their level of military support to Ukraine.\\nThe monetary value of support by Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark to Ukraine is set to exceed $2 billion by year’s end.\\n“Ukraine still needs our support to defend itself. It is important that we continue to help as best we can. The war, unfortunately, looks like it will last a long time. Our continued support for Ukraine is essential,” said Antti Kaikkonen, Finland’s defense minister.\\nFinland is moving ahead with its 10th military aid package (MAP) to Ukraine since Russia invaded that country in February 2022. The latest shipment of weapons, which is valued at $58.5 million, includes specialist sniper rifles, mortars, munitions, in addition to extreme climate combat equipment and clothing.\\nThe latest batch in aid increases Finland’s total spending on defense equipment to Ukraine to around $200 million.\\nAmong the Nordic states, Sweden is set to become the largest provider of direct military aid to Ukraine in 2022. Sweden has ratified a new MAP for Ukraine, worth $290 million, that will include an air defense system and munitions from the Swedish Armed Force’s (SAF) stockpile. The delivery will be Sweden’s biggest aid package since the outbreak of war.\\n“For security reasons we are not detailing what is in this military support package, but it is substantial,” said Pål Jonsson, Sweden’s minister of defense.\\nSweden’s $290 million package may include the military’s RBS 70 (Robotsystem 70) man-portable air-defense system which is designed for anti-aircraft warfare in all climate zones. RB 70 missiles can also be deployed in some of the armed forces’ other missile systems.\\nThe latest MAP is not expected to include the Archer Artillery System self-propelled guns. The howitzers might form part of a future donation. In June 2022, Sweden’s Ministry of Defense signed a letter of intent to purchase 24 additional Archer 155-millimeter mobile howitzers from BAE Systems Bofors AB.\\nDanish-delivered military support deliveries for Ukraine have included shoulder-launched anti-tank weapons and Harpoon long-range anti-ship missiles sourced from the Danish Defense Forces’ (DDF) stocks. In August, the Danish government approved a new MAP valued at $141.2 million to finance weapons procurement and training.\\nFor its part, Norway has allocated $443 million to a financially reinforced military support program for 2022-2023. In addition, the country plans to contribute $1 billion in civilian and humanitarian aid to Ukraine over the same period.\\nNorway’s $443 million MAP will cover the procurement of artillery, Arctic weather combat equipment and other defensive weapons systems, in addition to training programs for Ukrainian soldiers. Norway is also providing funds to weapons acquisition programs led by NATO, the European Union and Britain.\\nIn MAPs completed since March 2022, Norway has donated over 4,000 M72 anti-tank weapons and an air-defense-system weapons from the Norwegian Armed Forces’ (NAF) stockpiles to Ukraine. MAP shipments to Ukraine have included 14 Iveco LAV III Armored Vehicles and 23 self-propelled artillery vehicles (M109 howitzers), including associated gear, spare parts and ammunition.\\nIn addition, Norway entered agreements to purchase M72 anti-tank weapons and M141 rocket launchers, in deals totaling $30 million, for direct onward supply to Ukraine\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Army will decide whether it will further pursue a hybrid version of the BAE Systems-built Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle in fiscal 2023, according to budget justification documents.\\nThe service has been working to develop a hybrid Bradley for several years and will wrap up the process through a series of tests in FY22.\\nThe funding for hybrid Bradley prototyping is not broken out of a combat vehicle prototyping line item of $164 million in FY22, according to the documents. The funding includes other efforts to examine advanced combat vehicle concepts, next-generation fire control technologies, XM913 chain gun development and even a vehicle protection technology demonstrator.\\nThe Bradley vehicle is already pushed to the maximum when it comes to using power to support everything from running the vehicle to controlling its payloads. Going hybrid would provide other benefits as well such as greater survivability by reducing thermal and acoustic signatures, better acceleration, increased lethality and more onboard power to support the possible incorporation of high-energy lasers, according to budget documents.\\nThe Army plans to conclude development efforts in the third quarter of FY22 and will then test prototypes at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Testing at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, will also take place beginning in the fourth quarter of FY22.\\nBoth testing efforts will come to a close in the first quarter of FY23, the justification books show.\\nEarlier this year, a 3rd Infantry Division unit at Fort Stewart, Georgia, became the first unit equipped with the modernized M2A4 Bradley following the Army’s decade-long effort to upgrade the vehicles.\\nClarification: This story has been updated with more information on the organization investigating the Dec. 15 F-35B crash.\\nWASHINGTON — The F-35 Joint Program Office has grounded a small number of newer F-35 Joint Strike Fighters in response to the Dec. 15 incident in which a hovering fighter crashed on a Texas runway and its pilot ejected.\\nIn a statement to Defense News on Tuesday, the F-35 Joint Program Office confirmed it issued guidance as a result of the incident and that some higher-risk F-35s are grounded, at least until January. The JPO, which said the guidance was dated Tuesday, declined to specify how many F-35s are unable to fly.\\n“The F-35 Joint Program Office has issued a Time Compliance Technical Directive (TCTD) to restrict some aircraft, which have been evaluated to be of higher risk, from flight operations while the investigation into the mishap on December 15 continues and until procedures can be developed for their return to flight,” the JPO said. “The affected aircraft have been identified, and the JPO will work with the [U.S. military] services and [international] partners to ensure compliance with the TCTD.”\\nVideo of the dramatic F-35B crash earlier this month at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas, and its pilot’s successful on-the-ground ejection quickly went viral on social media.\\nLockheed Martin builds the vast majority of F-35s at its facility in Fort Worth, and the company had not yet transferred this new F-35B to the U.S. government when the crash occurred. Pratt & Whitney makes the F135 propulsion systems that power all variants of the F-35.\\nThe U.S. Air Force pilot, who was performing quality checks on the F-35B for the Defense Contract Management Agency, can be seen hovering the fighter not far above the ground in the crash video. The fighter descends, bounces off the ground and tips forward. Its nose and then right wing touch the ground, the fighter starts to spin around, and the pilot ejects.\\nThe JPO would not say what caused the grounded F-35s to be deemed at a higher risk.\\nA source familiar with the program, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the incident, said the initial assessment of the investigation, which is being conducted by the Naval Air Systems Command with the support of the JPO, found that a propulsion system issue led to the Dec. 15 crash of the hovering F-35B, which has now led to broader groundings in the fleet.\\nThe source said that, in guidance to the services, the JPO said a failure of a tube used to transfer high-pressure fuel in the fighter’s F135 engine prompted the office to update its safety risk assessments.\\nThe JPO also told the services that jets with fewer than 40 hours of flying are affected, this source said.\\nThe JPO declined to confirm that information.\\nPratt & Whitney said in a statement to Defense News it could not comment on the Dec. 15 crash because it involves an ongoing investigation.\\nIn its Tuesday statement to Defense News, the JPO said the groundings were put into place after a “preliminary assessment of the risk” and that it was taking steps it hoped would allow the directive to be modified sometime in January.\\n“The safety of flight crews is the JPO’s primary concern,” the statement concluded.\\nThough the JPO would not say exactly how many F-35s were grounded, it confirmed the grounded jets include all three variants. Some of those grounded F-35s are American fighters.\\nThe news site Times of Israel on Sunday reported the Israeli Air Force had grounded 11 of its F-35s due to the incident, and that they would be checked for similar issues. Israel flies the F-35I, which is based on the F-35A.\\nIn a statement to Defense News, Lockheed Martin said it is continuing to work with Navy officials in Fort Worth following the incident, and the company referred other questions on the groundings to the JPO.\\nLockheed Martin said on its website it has so far delivered more than 875 F-35s to the U.S. military and the program’s partner nations.\\nWASHINGTON — The Air Force wants to retire 310 aircraft, including 42 A-10 Warthogs, as part of its fiscal 2024 budget to free up money for its modernization programs.\\nThe proposed FY24 budget calls for buying 72 fighters — 48 Lockheed Martin-made F-35As and 24 Boeing F-15EX Eagle IIs — and spending more on the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider stealth bomber, the Boeing E-7A battle management and command-and-control aircraft, the Northrop Grumman-made next-generation nuclear missile known as the Sentinel, and the network of drone wingmen the Air Force calls collaborative combat aircraft, meant to eventually fly alongside crewed fighters.\\nThe Department of the Air Force is requesting $215.1 billion in 2024, $9.3 billion, or 4.5%, over the amount enacted for fiscal 2023. That includes a proposed budget of $185.1 billion for the Air Force itself, up $5.4 billion from 2023, and $30 billion for the Space Force, up $3.9 billion increase from 2023.\\nNearly $5 billion of that total budget growth would go to research, development test and evaluation spending, bringing that section’s funding up to $55.4 billion in 2024.\\nThe Air Force’s plan to retire 310 aircraft in 2024 would be far greater than the 150 retirements it recommended in the 2023 budget, though Congress ultimately approved just 115 of those. If lawmakers approve all, or even most, of these retirements, it would represent a significant step forward in the service’s effort to weed out older, outdated airframes from its fleet.\\nIf approved, the proposed retirement of 42 A-10s in 2024 would follow this year’s retirement of 21 Warthogs, and would leave the service with 218 of the attack aircraft. The Air Force has tried for years to retire the Warthog, arguing it would be too vulnerable against an enemy with advanced air defenses, and instead use the money to pay for newer fighters.\\nAir Force Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown told reporters at the Air and Space Forces Association’s symposium in Colorado March 7 the service wants to have all A-10s retired by 2029. Until recently, Congress has blocked the Air Force’s attempts to retire the A-10.\\nThe Air Force also wants to retire 57 F-15 C and D fighters. Some those Eagle jets are around four decades old, and are reaching the end of their lives. The Air Force plans to bring on new F-35s, as well as newly-made F-15EX Eagle II fighters from Boeing, to replace those retiring fighters.\\nAnd the service is already withdrawing dozens of older F-15s from Kadena Air Base in Japan for retirement, replacing them with rotational fighters such as F-22s.\\nThe Air Force is taking another shot at retiring 32 Block 20 F-22A Raptor fighters, which are not combat-capable and are now primarily being used for training purposes. Congress last year blocked the Air Force’s first attempt at retiring 33 of those F-22s.\\nThe Air Force also wants to take more steps toward retiring the E-3 Sentry airborne warning and control system, or AWACS, aircraft in 2024.\\nThe Air Force suggested retiring 15 of its 31 AWACS in its 2023 budget proposal, but lawmakers granted only 13 of those retirements. And Congress placed conditions on those retirements, requiring the service to produce a report on the E-3 retirement as well as its acquisition strategy for replacing it with the E-7.\\nMaj. Gen. Michael Greiner, the Air Force’s deputy assistant secretary for budget, told reporters in a March 10 briefing at the Pentagon that the Air Force believes it has met the requirements for the 13 AWACS retirements this year, which would bring its total fleet down to 18.\\nAnd in the 2024 budget proposal, the service said it wants to retire two more E-3s, leaving it with 16.\\nROME — As the European Union figures out how to spend €1 billion on bullets and shells for Ukraine, the buildup of a massive weapons cash pile it will use is sparking debate about the bloc’s new-found appetite for arms purchases.\\nBetter known for trade deals and farming subsidies, the EU now boasts a war chest of €8 billion, known as the European Peace Facility, which it is using to arm Russia’s neighbors, compensating EU states which donate tanks, planes and guns to Kyiv – and now buying ammunition for Ukraine.\\nThe questions are however coming fast, starting with a key conundrum: Should the money be lavished on manufacturers in the EU states supplying the money, or used anywhere that ensures quick purchases, even if that means U.S. manufacturers?\\nSpeedy buying has been central to the promise made by the bloc in March to provide one million items of ammunition to Ukraine within 12 months as the country’s fighters run short ahead of an expected counter-offensive against invading Russian forces.\\nTo achieve that, the EU Council earmarked €1 billion from the Peace Facility to partially compensate EU members donating their stocks to Ukraine and another €1 billion for joint procurement of new ammunition.\\nBut while France has said it would prefer to see the €1 billion procurement made in Europe, Poland has pushed for no limits on where the cash is spent, said Jean-Pierre Maulny, the deputy director at French think tank IRIS and scientific coordinator of its ARES defense research group.\\n“France believes there is no problem obtaining this amount of ammunition from European suppliers, but Poland does not agree,” he said, adding that material could be supplied by Finland, France, Germany and the Czech Republic.\\nOne reason for the discussion is that the EU is still writing the rules as it gets used to becoming an arms buyer.\\nSet up in March 2021, the Peace Facility was given a €5 billion budget and funded armed forces in countries like North Macedonia, Moldova, Nigeria, Jordan and Georgia.\\nFollowing Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the budget was beefed up as the fund focused on aiding Kyiv, and now stands at just under €8 billion for the period 2021-2027.\\nCompensation to EU states which donate defense materials to Ukraine are now underway, with Slovakia, for example, saying it hopes to receive about €200 million from the fund after handing over kit including 13 out-of-commission Mikoyan MiG-29 fighter jets.\\n“The EPF’s prime objective is to strengthen Europe’s defense capacities, so of course it would be best if the funds were used to develop European defense manufacturing capabilities,” said Tomasz Smura, the head of the research office of the Warsaw-based think tank Casimir Pulaski Foundation\\n“Naturally, the EU’s largest countries, who are also major weapon producers, are taking steps to ensure that the reimbursements are primarily used to reinforce the European defense industry,” he said.\\nReimbursement payments have come under scrutiny recently after a Politico report in March suggested that Estonia had applied a value calculation of donated equipment that unduly taxed collective coffers, billing the EPF for the cost of comparable new kit.\\nThe Estonian government denied any wrongdoing, saying it had acted in accordance with reimbursement policies.\\nAnd in the case of Slovakia’s warplanes transaction, Defense Minister Jaroslav Nad announced having received a U.S. offer for 12 Bell AH-1Z attack helicopters at $340 million that an Associated Press article described as “compensation” for the Ukraine donation.\\nOn Nov. 15 last year, the EU issued a rule that compensation cash handed out did not have to be spent in the bloc – it could also be used to buy most products in the United States.\\nDetailing the decision, an EU spokesperson told Defense News, “EU member states have agreed on a series of rules, particularly when the items are on the Common Military List of the European Union, which limit their origin to EU, member states and a number of non-EU countries, including the U.S.”\\nThose other non-EU countries include Norway, Canada, Israel, South Korea, the U.K. and others, the spokesperson added.\\nThe EU’s Common Military List, which is a long list of defense products governed by EU export rules, includes guns, howitzers, cannons, mortars, anti-tank weapons, rifles, rockets, missiles, bombs, ships, aircraft, drones, tanks and armored vehicles.\\nIt also includes ammunition. However, in March, when the European Union Council issued recommendations for speeding up the joint ammunition purchase for Ukraine using Peace Facility funds, it stated: “The Council further calls on member states to jointly procure 155-mm ammunition and, if requested, missiles for Ukraine in the fastest way possible before 30 September 2023 from the European defense industry (and Norway).”\\nExplaining why the recommendation excluded U.S. purchases despite the Peace Facility rules allowing such buys, an EU source, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive deliberations, told Defense News the rules had been conceived to help armed forces around the world which benefited from the fund and might have needed to buy from outside the EU.\\nThe huge amounts of money involved in the ammunition buy, meanwhile, meant the cash was better off being spent in the EU, the source argued.\\n“It is however a recommendation and is now being discussed,” he said.\\nThe EU spokesperson added, “The EPF is an instrument in the hands of the member states. They decide how the EPF is used.” The spokesperson described ongoing discussions as confidential.\\n“I can see why member states would be uncomfortable about putting money in a pot which subsidizes U.S. industry, but reality bites if your own industry cannot meet the requirement fast enough,” said Daniel Fiott, an analyst at the Centre for Security, Diplomacy and Strategy (CSDS) of the Brussels School of Governance.\\nJaroslaw Adamowski in Warsaw contributed this this report.\\nWASHINGTON — The House Armed Services Committee’s proposed version of the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act would throw a lifeline to a program aiming to develop a next-generation fighter jet engine.\\nThe chairman’s mark of the legislation, released Monday evening, would add $588.4 million for the Adaptive Engine Transition Program, to mature its technology and reduce risk.\\nThe Pentagon in March released a proposed fiscal 2024 budget with no AETP funding, instead moving forward with the Engine Core Upgrade, Pratt & Whitney’s proposal to upgrade the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter’s existing, Pratt-made F135 engines.\\nBut the House NDAA backs continuing work on both engine programs in 2024; it also fully funds the Engine Core Upgrade.\\nAETP was the other option the Pentagon was considering to modernize the F-35’s propulsion systems, which will need more power, thrust and cooling as the fighter receives key upgrades later this decade. These adaptive engines, prototypes of which have been developed by both Pratt & Whitney and General Electric Aerospace, would add a third stream of air to cool the engine, and would adapt to the best configuration for any given situation.\\nThe Air Force was interested in putting the adaptive engine in its F-35As. But the adaptive engine’s lack of interoperability with the U.S. Marine Corps’ F-35Bs, which have a unique engine that allows it to vertically take off and land, meant the Navy and Marines were uninterested in AETP.\\nIn a background briefing for reporters Monday, a senior congressional aide said lawmakers opted to restore AETP funding to keep the technology moving forward as the Defense Department continues developing the sixth-generation Next Generation Air Dominance platform, expected to use adaptive technology in its engine.\\nGE calls its adaptive engine the XA100, and Pratt’s adaptive engine is the XA101. Pratt said the adaptive engine it is developing is better suited for NGAD than the F-35.\\nThe committee’s draft of NDAA would also strike entirely the $150 million the Air Force requested to prototype its troubled Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW. And it would add another $20 million to the service’s budget request to prototype the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, or HACM, hypersonic program, which would bring its funding to more than $401 million.\\nARRW’s future is uncertain after a failed test in March prompted Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall to tell lawmakers the program had “struggled a little bit in its testing program,” and that the service was more committed to HACM.\\nThe committee’s tactical air and land forces panel also on Tuesday advanced without changes its section of the NDAA. That bill would grant the Air Force’s request to retire 42 more A-10 Warthogs, bringing its fleet of the attack aircraft down to 218, as well as 57 older F-15C and F-15D fighters.\\nROME — With a new CEO at the helm, Italy’s Leonardo is heading to the Paris Air Show with slimmed-down top management and a familiar face overseeing the firm’s key divisions.\\nAfter two mandates and six years on the job, Alessandro Profumo stepped down at the state-controlled firm last month to be replaced by Roberto Cingolani, 61, who will take Leonardo to the French event, which runs June 19-25.\\nCingolani was a chief technology and innovation officer at Leonardo who pushed cyber and artificial intelligence programs, but he left in 2021 to become a so-called green transition minister in the Italian government.\\nHis return to the firm as CEO and general manager was reportedly backed by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni over the advice of her defense minister, Guido Crosetto.\\nCrosetto’s preferred candidate was Lorenzo Mariani, the head of the Italy-based arm of European missile-maker MBDA. However, Mariani did not go away empty-handed, as he is taking on the role of co-general manager at Leonardo.\\nAnd the role comes with real responsibility: Leonardo’s division heads will report to him, a company source told Defense News on Thursday.\\nGiving Mariani a senior role involves some risk. In 2002, two managers asked to jointly run Leonardo, then known as Finmeccanica. But the hierarchy didn’t work out, and one executive, Roberto Testore, was jettisoned.\\nAt the division level, the new CEO has decided most managers will keep their jobs, including Marco Zoff at the aircraft division, Gian Piero Cutillo at helicopters, Stefano Bortoli at aerostructures and Tommaso Profeta at cyber systems, the source said.\\nBut at the electronics division, Gabriele Pieralli is being replaced by Marco De Fazio, the former No. 2 at the business unit. Pieralli is now taking up an executive role at Telespazio, a space services company Leonardo controls.\\nAnd former Leonardo strategy chief Giovanni Soccodato replaced Mariani as boss of MBDA’s Italian arm on June 1.\\nMeanwhile, the number of managers running corporatewide tasks for personnel, legal affairs, compliance, finance and sustainability are now reduced to eight from 13 as Cingolani slims down top management, the firm announced Thursday.\\nCingolani himself will take responsibility for strategy and technology business activities, a role similar to the one he had at the firm between 2019 and 2021.\\nThere’s also a new role for Leonardo’s space division, reflecting the firm’s growing interest in the field. Franco Ongaro, a former European Space Agency staffer, is stepping up as manager for the unit. Ongaro had succeeded Cingolani as chief technology and innovation officer when the latter left Leonardo in 2021.\\nSTUTTGART, Germany — France’s government is pouring hundreds of billions of euros into shoring up its military apparatus via its newest military programming law, which, if enacted, would support new capability efforts and ongoing programs through the end of the decade.\\nOfficials unveiled the proposed 2024-2030 military programming law (LPM) on April 4, ahead of presenting it to France’s legislative bodies. The five-year programming law has been in development since spring 2022, and was honed during top-level meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, and Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu, said Army Col. Yann Latil, director of the ministry’s strategic capability cell, during an April 3 media briefing.\\nIn January, Macron first announced that the LPM would include €400 billion ($435 billion) in investments, and cover a total of €413 ($450) billion in military needs. The investments are intended to target several areas of focus, to include a need for additional munitions and weaponry in the wake of Russia’s attack on Ukraine and a return to high intensity conflict on the European continent. Officials also cited increasing tensions in the Indo-Pacific region, and the increasingly speedy pace of technology innovation as incentives for the priorities set in this programming law.\\nThe ministry plans to request an additional €1.5 billion be added to the 2023 annual defense budget, bringing it from €43.9 billion to about €45.4 billion. The annual budgets would then increase year over year by at least €3 billion through 2030, said François Bolard, the ministry’s budget adviser.\\nSpecifically, the budget will increase by €3.1 billion in the 2024 budget; by €3 billion in 2025, 2026, and 2027, and by €4.3 billion in 2028, 2029, and 2030, he told reporters. By 2030, France’s annual defense budget is expected to top €60 billion; nearly double the amount allocated in 2017 of €32 billion, he added.\\nOver the course of the next five years, the French military is both continuing ongoing capability reboots and launching new initiatives.\\nThe development of the nation’s next-generation aircraft carrier, dubbed PANG for the French porte-avion nouvelle generation, will kick into high gear, with plans to put the Naval Group-built carrier to sea in 2036-2037, and begin trials in 2037-2038, officials said. Also in the maritime domain, France is scheduled to receive 15 new frigates by 2030, including three new FDI models meant for defense and intervention.\\nFrance’s air force will see the entry of the MBDA-developed, renovated medium range air-to-surface (ASMPA-R) missile during this budget cycle, as well as the development of its expected successor, the fourth-generation nuclear air-to-ground (ASN4G) hypersonic cruise missile that will succeed it. ArianeGroup is on contract to develop and manufacture the new missile.\\nParis will continue its timeline to achieve an “all Rafale” air fleet by 2035, and expects to procure 32 new fighter jets from contractor Dassault Aviation within the LPM, which will be delivered between 2030 and 2032, officials said. The Future Combat Air System (FCAS) next-generation fighter and weapon program in development by France, Spain, and Germany, should see its first fighter demonstrator come to fruition under this LPM, in 2027.\\nThe French military will also continue to modernize its land forces via the mammoth “Scorpion” overhaul program of its ground vehicles and associated equipment. Studies on the design for the Franco-German Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) next-generation tank will continue in the time period, officials said.\\nIn the space domain, France plans to launch a new orbital space surveillance project, using nanosatellites to patrol Geostationary Orbit (GEO), identify potential on-orbit threats to national assets, and if necessary, disable the threat with an on-board laser\\nIn partnership with the national space center CNES, the Air and Space Force intends to launch a demonstrator nanosatellite in 2023 under the “Yoda” project, with the system in development by contractor Hemeria. By 2030, a mature capability dubbed “Egide” would take on the “patrolling satellite” mission, the officials said.\\nThe on-orbit laser is being developed under the “FLAMHE” project moniker. France is also anticipating developing a ground-to-space laser system dubbed BLOOMLASE, with both capabilities to be operational by the end of the decade.\\nWhile undersea warfare has become a major topic in France since former Defense Minister Florence Parly released the first undersea strategy in early 2022, ministry officials could not provide a fixed funding number for investments in the domain. They said only that it would be in the “hundreds of millions” of euros, and include investments in underwater drones that can reach 6,000 meters of depth, other types of undersea and subsea remotely operated vehicles, and upgrades to anti-mine vessels.\\nA report issued Monday by the French Ministry of Defense detailed the following planned investments:\\nThe €400 billion investments outlined in this programming law do not include any military support France might provide to Ukraine in the future, officials told reporters. “The Ukraine support is something that could evolve in time, and the president wanted to guarantee the evolution of this support could never impact our own capability buildup,” Bolard said. The bulk of France’s support to Ukraine would come via the European Union’s off-book European Peace Facility (EPF) funding mechanism, but officials did not share how much funding has been allocated to aid to Ukraine to date.\\nThe French administration hopes the LPM will be voted on by Congress before the July 14th holiday, Bolard said.\\nWASHINGTON — A House draft of the fiscal 2024 defense policy bill would require the Army secretary conduct an analysis for determining which systems could store and distribute electric power on the battlefield.\\nThe service’s reliance on battery-powered capabilities to manage daily operations is increasing. Soldiers need batteries to, for example, operate the Samsung-based Nett Warrior situational awareness system, and to keep command posts and operations centers running.\\nThe Army is also moving toward using electric vehicles on the battlefield and alternative energy power sources for its facilities and bases. The Army’s climate strategy released in early 2022 lays out a plan to field hybrid tactical vehicles by 2035 and moving to all-electric tactical vehicles by 2050.\\nTo get there, the Army told Defense News in the spring of 2022, it was preparing its first-ever operational energy strategy, expected by the end of the year. No such strategy has materialized.\\nAccording to legislation proposed by the House Armed Services Committee’s readiness panel, the Army would have one year to conduct its analysis of alternatives following enactment.\\n“The Secretary shall develop study guidance under which such an analysis is required to include for consideration as such potential alternatives to the full range of military commercially available capabilities for the storage and distribution of electric power,” the draft legislation states.\\nFor each alternative examined, the legislation reads, the Army should include per unit cost, mobility levels, the ability to store and distribute electric power necessary for charging soldier-worn devices, the ability to store or distribute power through a network or microgrid for tactical command posts, and any other capabilities needed to meet operational requirements.\\nOnce the analysis is complete, the Army secretary will have 90 days to deliver it to congressional defense committees. The report should include the full range of capabilities considered and an assessment of the types of analysis used to determine costs and benefits.\\nThe report should also lay out concerns with prospective options related to “acquisition, operational requirements or user communities,” the draft legislation states, to include cost, capabilities and interoperability with existing or planned systems.\\nThe proposed legislation would push the service to map out how it manages and distributes power in operations across the battlefield and to consider existing technology that could strengthen that logistics tail — from longer-lasting, lighter batteries to trailer-sized chargers to microgrids.\\nIndustry has been busy coming up with ways to answer the call to support an ever-increasing electric-powered battlefield.\\nOshkosh has developed a hybrid version of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle; and the Army’s new JLTV-maker, AM General, will also be expected to deliver the capability when the Army decides to move out on a requirement. Teams designing concepts for the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle that will ultimately replace the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle are also incorporating hybrid capability.\\nCompanies developing microgrids like Schneider Electric, which built one that powers Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, are showing interest in the Army’s push to use the technology at installations and on the battlefield.\\nPlasan North America has spent the last year pitching its All-Terrain Electric Mission Module. The ATeMM is a single platform that solves a variety of power capability and logistics issues, including attaching to a vehicle and converting it into a hybrid platform, serving as a supplemental generator to power command posts, or acting as a mass mobile charging station for conformable wearable batteries.\\nThe Army has made some headway engaging with industry over the past few years. For example, the service’s Combat Capabilities Development Command’s Ground Vehicle Systems Center has hosted electrification forums across the U.S., asking companies whether they were focused on how to recharge in an austere environment, Michael Cadieux, the center’s director, told Defense News last year.\\nAt first, industry didn’t raise their hand, but now there has been a significant shift, Cadieux said at the time. Industry is “coming to the table and engaging with us, saying … they have something that [they] think is a unique product or capability and it starts to address or get at tactical recharging.”\\nWASHINGTON — The Pentagon will begin incorporating climate analysis into its war-gaming and analysis efforts as well as featuring the issue as part of its future National Defense Strategy.\\nThe announcement by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin came shortly after President Joe Biden signed a series of executive orders targeting the climate crisis.\\nThe Defense Department “will immediately take appropriate policy actions to prioritize climate change considerations in our activities and risk assessments, to mitigate this driver of insecurity. As directed by the President, we will include the security implications of climate change in our risk analyses, strategy development, and planning guidance,” Austin said in a statement.\\n“As a leader in the interagency, the Department of Defense will also support incorporating climate risk analysis into modeling, simulation, wargaming, analysis, and the next National Defense Strategy. And by changing how we approach our own carbon footprint, the Department can also be a platform for positive change, spurring the development of climate-friendly technologies at scale.”\\n“There is little about what the Department does to defend the American people that is not affected by climate change,” Austin concluded. “It is a national security issue, and we must treat it as such.”\\nFor years, the DoD has acknowledged that environmental change could pose a threat to military capabilities. In fiscal 2020, the department doled out $67 million in funds to help bases alleviate or repair climate-related damage. A 2018 report by the Center for Climate and Security identified a number of key domestic military installations, including both North Carolina’s Camp Lejeune and Camp Pendleton in California, as at-risk from climate change. In 2019, a number of bases were hit by large weather events, including Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, which required more than $400 million in repairs.\\nBut under the Trump administration, defense officials were careful to use such statements to acknowledge logistical concerns and they refused to comment on whether climate change is real or human-made.\\nThat is now officially changed — unsurprisingly, given the focus Biden said his administration will place on fighting climate change, including putting former Secretary of State John Kerry into a new role with the National Security Council, where he will focus entirely on the issue.\\nThe public version of the Trump administration’s National Security Strategy included only a single mention of climate-related concerns; the public version of the National Defense Strategy, a more DoD-focused document, did not raise the issue. Austin’s statement could be a sign the issue will feature prominently whenever the next NDS is released.\\nThe indication from Austin that the department will look to change its carbon footprint is also notable, as the Pentagon is often reported as being the largest single consumer of fossil fuels in the United States. Already, planners in the department were looking for alternatives, such as nuclear reactors, to help limit the logistics train needed for the military.\\nWASHINGTON — Training Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 fighters is a key step in building that nation’s future air force, U.S. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said Monday — but he doubts Fighting Falcons will change the course of Ukraine’s war against Russia.\\nF-16s “will give the Ukrainians an increment of capability that they don’t have right now,” Kendall said in a breakfast roundtable with reporters hosted by the Defense Writers Group. “But it’s not going to be a dramatic game-changer, as far as I’m concerned, for their total military capabilities.”\\nKendall said that while F-16s will help Ukraine, they won’t fundamentally alter the balance of power in the war. Effective ground-based air defenses on both sides have meant airpower has not played a decisive role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Kendall said, and fighters have been used in fairly limited ways as a result.\\nFor more than a year, Ukraine has repeatedly asked the United States and European nations to provide fourth-generation F-16s or other fighters. Those requests were always rebuffed.\\nThe situation changed last week, when President Joe Biden announced the United States would support training Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s, paving the way for Ukraine to receive those fighters.\\nAt Monday’s breakfast, Kendall said Ukraine has been “very understandably unrestrained” in their requests for weapons and hardware such as F-16s from the United States and other nations.\\nBut other weapons packages to Ukraine have been “incredibly useful” in thwarting Russia’s initial drive to seize Kyiv and much of the country, he said, and then pushing Russian forces out of much of the territory it claimed in the early months of the war. Ukraine has used Western weapons such as High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, precision rockets and Javelin anti-tank weapons to devastating effect against Russia.\\nKendall said the West prioritized sending Ukraine those weapons that would be most effective on the battlefield, before shifting focus to laying the groundwork for a future Ukrainian air force.\\nHe said providing fighters such as F-16s “is seen by some as an escalatory act on our part.”\\nSpeed was also a factor in deciding which weapons to concentrate on first providing to Ukraine, Kendall said. Getting significant quantities of fighters into Ukrainian hands would take months at best, he said, so instead the West looked for armaments that could be more quickly shipped.\\nKendall reiterated comments he and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown made in July 2022 that eventually, Ukraine will have to move away from its current force of Russian-made Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker and MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters and toward Western-made jets.\\n“Ukraine is going to remain an independent nation,” Kendall said. “It’s going to need a full suite of military capabilities. And so it’s time to start thinking longer-term about what that military might look like, and what it might include.”\\nKendall said the U.S. and other partner nations will work with Ukraine to “figure out a path” toward getting the jets — but it won’t happen soon. He said it will likely take at least several months for Ukraine to receive them.\\nMany details also have yet to be sorted out, Kendall added , such as where the F-16s will come from, and where their pilots will train.\\n“We’re just starting our conversations about how we’re going to move forward after the president’s announcement,” he said. “A lot of open possibilities [for training], including our partners.”\\nNBC News reported in March two Ukrainian pilots were at a military base in Tucson, Arizona, to help sort out how quickly the nation’s fighter pilots could learn to fly advanced fighters such as F-16s. The Air National Guard’s 162nd Wing in Tucson trains pilots from international partner nations to fly the F-16.\\nBut Kendall was optimistic about Ukrainian pilots’ abilities to learn to fly the F-16, saying it would take “months, not years.”\\n“They’re very motivated,” Kendall said. “Everything we’ve done with the Ukrainians, they’ve shown a capacity to learn. I don’t think I’ve ever seen more motivated individuals, in terms of wanting to get into the fight and make a difference.”\\nSTUTTGART, Germany – The French military has awarded Naval Group a new contract to study the design of a future armed unmanned underwater vehicle, the company announced June 7.\\nThe nine-month study will allow Naval Group to examine principal use cases and develop system architectures for an Unmanned Combat Underwater Vehicle, or UCUV. Its missions would include intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), with the idea of helping the French military “master” the seabed, according to Naval Group.\\nThe Armed Forces Ministry’s procurement office, the Direction Générale de l’Armement, awarded the contract on May 4, per a company statement.\\nThe study comes as Naval Group prepares its extra-large unmanned underwater vehicle (XL-UUV) demonstrator for sea qualification this summer. The company began developing the system in 2016 and first unveiled it in 2021.\\nOnce qualified, Naval Group will use the XL-UUV to test various “technological bricks” in a short cycle, the company said. One such brick could be the Controlled Decision-Making Autonomy (ADC) capability, developed with France’s national aerospace research center ONERA to be an “onboard brain for drones.”\\n“This first UCUV project paves the way for additional work to quickly develop the key technological bricks of such a drone, in relation to the development of the first demonstrator,” Naval Group said in the release.\\nThe company did not respond to questions regarding the cost of the study before this article’s publication.\\nSeabed warfare has become a dominant topic of conversation in Europe, especially for the French military. Paris was the first government to issue a dedicated military strategy for the ocean floor domain in early 2022, and a portion of the nation’s €10 billion ($10.7 billion) dedicated to innovation in the proposed 2024-2030 Military Program Law will focus on the topic. A key goal for Paris is to develop an underwater drone that can reach depths of 6,000 meters.\\nThe lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, voted on Wednesday to approve the six-year programming law, known as the Loi de Programmation Militaire (LPM) in French, by a vote of 408-87. The bill now goes to the Senate as the upper chamber for a vote.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Army on Friday issued a draft request for proposals for the preliminary design phase of its delayed optionally manned fighting vehicle, or OMFV, the first major step in a relaunched competition to replace the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle.\\nThe preliminary phase will be open for 40 days, with the goal of gathering industry feedback ahead of the final RFP, which will come later this year. That final RFP will award of up to five design contracts in June 2021, setting the next stage in the competition.\\n“As we continue to progress through the first phase of our five-phased approach for the OMFV program, communication, inclusive feedback and innovative thinking from industry remains key,” Maj. Gen. Brian Cummings, the Army’s program executive officer for ground combat systems, said in a statement. “We are looking forward to receiving feedback and learning from industry what’s in the realm of the possible as we continue to develop this truly transformational vehicle for our Soldiers.”\\nAdded Brig. Gen. Ross Coffman, director of the Next Generation Combat Vehicles Cross-Functional Team: “Accurately defining the desired set of capabilities without over-constraining the design is critically important.\\n“The Army is committed to open communication with industry to ensure the characteristics and eventual requirements of the OMFV are informed by technological advances.”\\nThe focus on gathering industry feedback should not be a surprise, given the recent history of the program. When the OMFV program was conceived, the Army planned to hold a prototyping competition, selecting two winning teams to build prototypes with a downselect to one at the end of an evaluation period.\\nBut in October, the Army ended up with only one bidder in the OMFV competition — General Dynamics Land Systems — after other competitors dropped out, citing requirements and schedule concerns.\\nAs a result, the Army in January announced it would be relaunching the program to ensure more competition going forward — a decision that led to service leaders taking heat from Congress during testimony in March. OMFV is the first large acquisition effort to come out of Army Futures Command.\\nThe draft RFP, posted on a government contracting website Friday, drives home the point by stating: “To permit industry design freedom and promote innovation, the Army has avoided quantifying or prescribing critical levels of performance wherever possible.”\\n“We do not want to box industry into a solution,” Cummings said. “We want to incentivize industry as they lean forward and think creatively to bring the Army innovative technologies and solutions necessary to achieve our vision — both in terms of the ability to integrate newer technology we are seeing today and leaving space for future growth on the OMFV platform.”\\nA 3rd Infantry Division unit at Fort Stewart, Georgia, is officially the first to be equipped with and trained on the modernized M2A4 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, marking the end of a decade long effort by the Army to upgrade their Bradley Fighting Vehicles.\\nSoldiers with 3rd Battalion, 67th Armor Regiment, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, first received the M2A4 variant in early February, the Army said in an April 23 release.\\nThe soldiers completed training on the new equipment during a series of events this March, the Army release stated.\\nIncluded in the Bradley Fighting Vehicle upgrade were enhancements to improve speed performance and increase power in the turret.\\n“This Bradley variant will ensure that the platform maintains combat relevance now and for decades to come as we wait for the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle platform to eventually replace it,” said Brig. Gen. Glenn Dean, who leads Program Executive Office-Ground Combat Systems.\\n“We fielded the most capable Bradley Fighting Vehicle to date, with the Bradley in service for three decades. Because the A4 variant has enhanced mobility and power generation, we’ll be able to integrate new technologies.”\\nThe Army plans to acquire more than 700 of the new M2A4 Bradleys through 2029. Each vehicle costs roughly $4.35 million.\\nThe Army plans to continue providing field units with the M2A4 variant until the new Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle is produced, which will eventually replace the Bradley.\\nThe last upgrade made to U.S. armored troop carriers came in 2002.\\nThe prototyping phase for the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle will begin in fiscal 2025, and the Army is expected to select in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2027 one company to build low-rate production vehicles.\\nFull-rate production isn’t expected to begin until fiscal 2030, meaning most soldiers will be using the M2A4 Bradley for years to come.\\nLONDON — Britain’s Ministry of Defence has funded the final step in the development of an active electronically scanned array radar destined for the Royal Air Force’s Typhoon combat jets.\\nThe agency announced July 4 it had awarded BAE Systems and Leonardo UK an £870 million ($1.1 billion) deal spanning five years to complete development and integration of the European Common Radar System Mk2 radar destined to equip British Typhoon batch 3 fighters.\\nThe deal covers design, development, demonstration and qualification and takes the radar to a production initial operating capability ready for integration into aircraft.\\nThe ECRS contract is the first part of a £2.35 billion investment plan unveiled by the British in mid-2022 to upgrade mission computers, jamming and other technologies on the RAF jets.\\nDefense officials here have remained vague about exactly when the Mk2-fitted Typhoon will be available operationally.\\nThe expectation is the upgraded aircraft will be in service by 2030, although program officials have indicated they would like to see the radar in action earlier if possible.\\nThe new ECRS Mk2 kit will be installed on around 40 RAF Typhoon tranche 3 aircraft, although the radar could also be installed on batch 2 aircraft if funds were available.\\nThe British MoD statement also said the radar could be offered to other nations that operate the aircraft. No potential customers were mentioned in the MoD statement.\\nTyphoon customers Kuwait and Qatar already operate a Leonardo-supplied scanned array system on their planes, leaving fellow user Saudi Arabia as the most likely option.\\nThe Saudis are the Typhoons’ largest export customer, and the Middle East country has been touted recently as having a possible interest in a further buy of the aircraft, which would likely involve a new radar.\\nGerman media reports last week suggested that a long-delayed purchase of Typhoon jets from BAE could be revived if the government in Berlin overcame opposition among some of its coalition members and approved the deal.\\nTyphoon production and development is a four-nation effort involving Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain.\\nThe new radar is considered the biggest single element of upgrades aimed at keeping Typhoon current until at least 2040. As such, the technology is a stepping stone towards new capabilities for the envisioned sixth-generation Global Combat Air Program being negotiated by Britain, Italy and Japan.\\n“ECRS Mk2 will not only provide critical capability to Typhoon but will also develop and sustain critical skills relevant to the Global Combat Air Programme.” Mark Hamilton, Leonardo’s managing director electronics UK, said.\\nA prototype of the Leonardo Mk2 radar was delivered to BAE’s Warton combat air site in northern England earlier this year ahead of integration on a British Typhoon.\\nGermany and Spain, meanwhile, have opted for a less ambitious radar dubbed Mk1.\\nItaly remains interested in the Mk2 for its Typhoon force but has yet to commit to the program even though Leonardo has Italian engineers working on the program at its main radar development sites in Scotland.\\nThe radar is currently undergoing specialist testing at Warton. A statement released by the MoD and BAE said initial flight testing is scheduled to start next year.\\nAt a briefing with reporters at Warton last year, officials said the first flight was expected in 2023.\\nIt appears now, though, that program officials have now reorganized some of the test program, increasing the amount of up-front ground testing. The shuffle has not affected the program’s overall timing, said officials.\\nRepublican leaders are pushing for a 5% increase in defense spending in the White House’s upcoming fiscal 2023 budget proposal, but the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee argued Wednesday big boosts for the military won’t necessarily mean improved national security.\\n“The budget should be driven by strategy, and not strategy driven by the budget,” Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., told reporters during a roundtable. “One of the problems [with the budget] is that too often we just pick a number, rather than say, ‘This is really what we have to do and these are the priorities.’\\n“As a result, we sometimes don’t put in the type of incentives so we will make decisions that are effective for national defense.”\\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to unveil his budget recommendations for fiscal 2023 on Monday. Even though the current fiscal year began Oct. 1, Congress only recently finalized its spending plans for FY22.\\nThe final budget deal included about $751 billion in defense funding, an increase of about 5%. In a letter to the White House Wednesday, 40 Republican members of the House and Senate Armed Services committees urged the administration to repeat that kind of increase next year.\\n“This is a crucial period for our national security,” the letter stated. “If we do not make the investments our military needs today, we will not be able to defend our nation or our allies in the future. The security of the free world depends on a credible American military.”\\nLast year, the White House proposed only a small increase in defense spending in its initial budget, which critics attacked as effectively a cut for military planners given inflation.\\nProgressive Democrats praised the move as a way to rein in ever-growing military spending and prioritize other domestic programs instead.\\nBut over their objections, moderate Democrats and Republicans ultimately added significantly more money to the defense accounts. The latest GOP letter is designed to start the fiscal 2023 defense budget debate at a higher target than last year.\\nThe Republican signers argued the money is needed for upgrades to cyber defense and the National Nuclear Security Administration, as well as “growing our naval and projection forces” and modernizing the rest of the fighting force.\\n“Congress acted in a bipartisan manner to provide nearly $30 billion more than you requested,” the letter stated. “We hope that action convinces you that overwhelming political support exists for increasing immediate investment in our national defense.”\\nBut Reed — who supported the higher defense spending levels in last year’s budget discussions — said lawmakers shouldn’t automatically assume the Defense Department needs hefty budget increases each year.\\n“We have lots of legacy systems which we maintain, in many cases, because of political choices rather than policy or strategy aspects,” he said. “We have to look at them. Are they still functional? Do we still need them?\\n“Let’s look at the strategy. Let’s look at the threats which drive strategy and then let’s see if we have a budget that meets those threats.”\\nReed would not identify the figure he wants for the total defense budget, but he said getting the budget finished in a timely manner should be a top priority for both parties, especially after the late completion of the current year spending plan.\\n“We’ve gotten into a very bad habit over the last several years with getting the budget” done on time, he said.\\n“Most services now, regrettably, don’t plan to do anything in the fourth quarter of the new fiscal year because they assume they won’t have a budget. … That’s not good and it’s also not an efficient way to spend money.”\\nReed said he is hopeful this year’s work on the defense appropriations and authorization bills can be finished in early fall, even with the late release of the White House’s budget suggestions.\\nLONDON – A British F-35B combat jet based on the new Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has crashed into the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the Ministry of Defence confirmed Nov. 17.\\nThe pilot ejected and has been picked up and returned safely to the carrier.\\nThe F-35B short-take-off, vertical-landing jet was one of eight British aircraft deployed on the Queen Elizabeth as it returned from a deployment in the Far East. The aircraft is one of 24 so far delivered to the British. The British are ordering 48 jets so far but have pledged to purchase 138, although that number is likely to be cut.\\nTen US Marine F-35B’s are also deployed on the carrier.\\nThe MoD said the crash occurred at 10:00 GMT during a routine operation from the carrier. No other aircraft were involved.\\nHMS Queen Elizabeth is on its maiden operational deployment, acting as the centerpiece of a British-led carrier strike group including U.S. and Dutch warships.\\nAn investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing, the MoD said on Wednesday.\\nSTUTTGART, Germany – The Spanish government officially signed off on the Eurodrone program this week, giving the fourth and final government approval needed for Europe’s preeminent unmanned aerial system to progress.\\nMadrid’s council of ministers gave the UAS program the green light on Tuesday, Airbus Defence and Space CEO Michael Schoellhorn shared on Twitter that day.\\nNow that Spain, Germany, France, and Italy have all declared budgetary approval for Eurodrone, the program is entering its contractual phase, an Airbus spokesperson told Defense News on Thursday.\\nThe four nations, their industry partners in the program, and the European intergovernmental Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) will now get together to finalize the global contract, the spokesperson said.\\nFrance, Germany, and Italy had previously announced their budgetary approval, and this final nod from Spain “paves the way for contract signature on this key collaborative programme, which strengthens Europe’s strategic autonomy & sovereignty,” Schoellhorn wrote.\\nAirbus’ head of military aircraft Jean-Brice Dumont also weighed in on the decision, writing on Twitter: “Eurodrone will see the development and consolidation of key operational technologies and new digital-based design and manufacturing that will define the aerospace of the future. This is strategic autonomy at the service of our society.”\\nAirbus will announce the Eurodrone engine provider once this global contract is signed and completed, the spokesperson added. Two vendors are vying for the opportunity to supply at least 120 engines under the initial contract, which includes 60 dual-engine aircraft.\\nOCCAR is managing the Eurodrone program on behalf of the four European partners. Airbus is representing both Germany and Spain – although the company’s Munich-based headquarters is officially the prime contractor – while France’s Dassault Aviation and Italy’s Leonardo are also involved. Airbus previously revealed that final assembly of the aircraft will occur in Manching, Germany.\\nAirbus’ chief Eurodrone engineer Daniela Lohwasser said in November that a formal contract signing might take a couple of months to be finalized, once Spain gave the go-ahead.\\nStakeholders expect more nations to sign onto the Eurodrone program once the formal contract is signed. The four current partners have ordered 20 systems, each comprising two ground stations and three aircraft. Germany has opted for seven systems, while Italy has committed to five, and Spain and France will each buy four systems.\\nFirst flight for the medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) drone is currently targeted for 2025, with deliveries slated to begin in 2028.\\nThe initial production contract is expected to cost around 7.1 billion euro (U.S. $7.95 billion). In 2021, the program received a 100 million euro (U.S. $118 million) grant from the European Union.\\nEUROPE and WASHINGTON — Shaken by an underwater explosion that ripped through the Nord Stream pipelines in September, European nations are waking up to the task of securing the ocean floors that house the continent’s arteries of wealth.\\nBut protecting the vast network of energy pipelines and communications cables that line the surrounding bodies of water comes down to a familiar question: Who’s in charge?\\nThat’s because the responsibilities for infrastructure that traverses multiple countries, is privately owned and serves vital national interests are anything but clear. Militaries, with their special skills and equipment for underwater operations, are expected to pick up a chunk of the work. But the scope of the assignment and the technologies involved is still coming into focus.\\nAnalysts consider seabed warfare a growing national security discipline with influences from submarine warfare, countermine operations and harbor protection.\\n“There are two thrusts here,” said Sebastian Bruns, a naval expert at the University of Kiel in northern Germany. For one, there are high-tech, offensive tactics that involve clusters of autonomous weapons quietly lying on the ocean floor until activated, potentially organizing into something like movable mine fields never to be recorded on any maps, he said.\\nAnd then there is the field of protecting critical underwater infrastructure, which has a lot to do with understanding, by way of sensors, what is going on around cables and pipelines, he added. Observing hard-to-reach places deep below the surface is challenging enough; being able to do it at the scale required is another.\\n“An analogy would be the assignment of two cop cars to watch over the entire highway network of the United States,” he said.\\nDevelopments are afoot in individual countries and at the European Union level. At the European Defence Agency, for example, officials are awaiting word from Italy in the first quarter of 2023 on a proposal for a dedicated program for critical seabed infrastructure protection. If approved, the effort could join the growing list of so-called PESCO projects — small, multinational government and industry teams whose work serves as a blueprint for solving specific military capability problems.\\nThe agency also is kicking off a series of studies in January to identify capability gaps and find emerging technology in industry that could fill them, said Conor Kirwan, an Irish naval officer detailed to EDA’s office on maritime programs in Brussels.\\nAlso planned is an examination of national governance mechanisms that touch underwater infrastructure protection.\\nThe analyses are expected to culminate in an EDA-sponsored symposium in late April that aims to bring together military and civilian authorities, private companies and academic researchers.\\nPeeling back the layers of authorities — military, civilian and commercial — may turn out to be the biggest impediment to Europeans acting jointly against threats. “That’s where the complexity around critical seabed infrastructure lies,” Kirwan said in an interview.\\nFrance has rushed ahead with new investments in the undersea domain ever since it became the first European nation to launch a national security-oriented seabed warfare strategy in February 2022.\\nOther nations have published seabed strategies before, but in more civilian capacities, such as the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association’s strategy for ocean mapping, exploration and characterization. What made France’s release stand out was its military emphasis, especially as Russia and China — considered adversaries by the U.S. and much of Western Europe — are heavily investing in ways to conduct warfare on the seabed, said Steven Horrell, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis.\\n“Russia and China are clearly moving out to utilize the seabed to hold at risk those transoceanic cables and other things on the seabed,” he told Defense News.\\nTraditionally, the military has focused on anti-submarine warfare in the undersea domain, he added. With the development of underwater unmanned vehicles and mine countermeasure missions, as well as the increasingly critical need to protect transoceanic cables and gas pipelines, that scope has widened.\\n“Seabed warfare is another evolution,” Horrell said.\\nFrance in particular has high stakes to conquer the mostly unexplored domain. The Earth’s seabed takes up about 139 million square miles, with an average depth of about 2.3 miles. According to France’s seabed strategy, of the approximately 450 submarine cables that convey 99% of intercontinental digital data exchanges, 51 cables land in French national territory (including 27 in metropolitan France), and 24 in overseas French territories.\\nAbout three-quarters of the seabed is accessible around 3,000 meters, the strategy states, while 97% is accessible at 6,000 meters — nearly 20,000 feet, thus the nation’s ambitions for reaching those depths.\\nAt the time of the strategy’s release, France only had two remotely operated vehicles capable of reaching 1,000 meters: the H1000 Ulisse and the H2000 Diomede. The two crafts were developed by ECA Group, which recently joined forces with navigation and autonomous systems developer iXblue to rebrand as Exail.\\nBut the Armed Forces Ministry soon announced new investments to test existing underwater vehicles capable of probing further depths, with a stated goal of developing one new sovereign autonomous underwater vehicle and one new remotely operated vehicle by 2025.\\nOn Dec. 15, the ministry announced plans to perform sea trials of Exail’s A18D AUV down to 3,000 meters starting in 2023, for a total of €3.5 million (U.S. $3.7 million). During the biennial Euronaval conference outside Paris this past October, the ministry announced a €4 million contract to similarly test the ability of Kongsberg Maritime’s Hugin Superior AUV to operate at depths of 6,000 meters.\\nThe ministry also signed on for a new six-month trial of Exail’s DriX medium-depth AUV to study more optimized means of launching and recovering unmanned systems. That trial is slated to begin in February 2023 aboard the hydrographic vessel Beautemps-Beaupré.\\nAll three AUVs underwent trials with the French military in 2020 and 2021 under the CHOF (capacité hydrographique et océanographique future) program, which aims to replace France’s three hydrographic vessels with newer ships that can more accurately monitor the seabed and underwater activities.\\nTo date, the DGA military procurement office has aimed to define the future architecture of the next-generation vessels; assess what types of autonomous systems would best help France see a twofold increase in surveying capabilities; and increase its coverage of the seabed by 10%.\\nAnother French program, SLAM-F, will see new developments in 2023: The ministry plans to begin ordering new anti-mine robots built by Thales early in the year, which will ultimately replace the Navy’s manned countermine warfare vessels.\\nWhile the ministry’s seabed strategy is focused on the military prospects in the domain, industry partners are also targeting civilian customers for their unmanned underwater vehicles.\\nFrench companies Marine Tech and Hologarde joined forces to develop the Manta unmanned hybrid vehicle, an all-electric drone envisioned as operating in three versions: as an underwater surface vehicle or subsurface vehicle at about 3 meters deep; as an underwater surface vehicle/autonomous unmanned vehicle at 300 meters deep; and as a platform able to operate down to 6,000 meters deep.\\nThe Manta, a silver vessel resembling its animal namesake, can provide ocean mapping, reconnaissance and underwater interventions. The variant that can operate down to 300 meters will be commercialized in January 2023, said Jean-Luc Pierrisnard, technical manager and co-founder of Marine Tech. The initial target customers are in the oil and gas sectors in the Middle East, Pierrisnard added.\\nUnder their temporary joint venture dubbed Marine Garde, Hologarde — a subsidiary of Aeroports de Paris — and Marine Tech developed the Manta, with 60% financial support from the French Armed Forces Ministry’s Defense Innovation Agency — an office similar to the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\\nThe project launched in 2019, when both companies were partnering with the agency on separate efforts. The businesses came together as the ministry began to seek new unmanned underwater vehicles for seabed operations, Pierrisnard and Hologarde Managing Director Thierry Lamaire told Defense News on the Euronaval show floor in October.\\nPierrisnard said the ultimate goal is to field a model that can work at depths of 6,000 meters, which will require a different motor and a resizing of the electronic units. No date is set for a sea trial, he added.\\nCompanies at Euronaval noted the challenges in not only developing unmanned underwater vehicles capable of descending to such depths, but in testing them. It can be prohibitively expensive for a small business to rent a boat and sail out to waters that are approved for testing and are that deep; thus, co-financing from government partners is critical, noted Lamaire.\\nThe Italian Navy is now actively involved in protecting subsea internet cables in the Mediterranean after signing a cooperation deal in July with Italian telecommunications company Sparkle.\\n“Joint activity is now underway on the cables we manage,” said Fabrizio Buglio, network and service platforms director at Sparkle, which owns or co-owns 600,000 kilometers (nearly 373,000 miles) of internet cables globally.\\nThe deal envisages the Navy would not only keep an eye on cables in the Mediterranean Sea but also share maps of the seabed and intervene in “emergency” operations.\\nRear Adm. Vito Lacerenza, the commander of the Italian submarine fleet, has said the Navy’s new sub types are designed to work with undersea drones, allowing the service to better watch cables.\\nBuglio said Sparkle already monitored the automatic identification system so it could know which ships were passing over its cables, as accidental damages can never be excluded. Buglio also said the firm was working with university research departments to see if subsea telecommunication cables can act as earthquake sensors.\\nAn Italian Navy source said the service was considering research work into the sensor concept, adding that the service was aware of work undertaken by the the U.K.’s National Physical Laboratory and other partners.\\nExperts at the lab there believe undersea pressure and vibrations change the way light travels through subsea fiber-optic cables, and those changes can be recorded. The team used a 5,860-kilometer cable between the U.K. and Canada for tests, discovering the spans between signal boosting repeaters could be used as individual sensors.\\nThat suggests the 400-plus subsea cables around the world could be harnessed as a global sensor network, spotting earthquakes and tsunamis.\\nTo be really useful to navies protecting cables, sensor readings would need to register nearby submarines or drones tampering with the cables, but a scientist with the lab, Giuseppe Marra, said that level of sensitivity is not yet in the cards.\\n“Earthquakes can be registered, but a submarine would be quite challenging, while more research is needed to sense tampering,” he said.\\nBritain is immersed in unmanned underwater technology, partly thanks to offshore oil and gas exploitation in the North Sea.\\nThe country has for years used submarines of various shapes and sizes to deploy and extract special forces on enemy coastlines. And the Royal Navy for several years now has used small, unmanned vehicles, mainly to hunt mines.\\nNow, technological breakthroughs are enabling all sorts of new unmanned underwater capabilities to be investigated, from anti-access and area-denial to surveillance, reconnaissance, protection of underwater infrastructure and most roles in between.\\nA recent £15 million (U.S. $18 million) deal between the Navy and MSubs — a small company in Plymouth, England, specializing in underwater tech — will see the service receive a 17-ton, 12-meter-long demonstrator vehicle with a mission range of 1,000 miles.\\nThe aim of the latest contract is to use the Cetus project, named after a mythological sea monster, to develop the Royal Navy’s operational understanding of long-endurance autonomous vehicles; to build trust in autonomous capabilities; to explore potential mission roles; and to inform how the vehicles fit into the underwater battlespace and the service’s future vision.\\nDelivery of the Cetus platform is scheduled within two years.\\nAnnouncing the deal early in November, the Royal Navy said part of the exploration activities would involve the potential for the vehicles to operate alongside conventional submarines, including the service’s Astute-class nuclear-powered hunter-killer boats.\\nIn addition to Cetus and ocean-surveillance ships, Britain is investing in capabilities to support an infrastructure protection program. The Defence Ministry revealed recently it intends to spend £20 million to acquire a remotely operated deep-water salvage vehicle with the ability to manipulate objects and produce high-resolution imagery down to a depth of 6,000 meters.\\nIndependent defense analyst John Louth said the ministry would like to field a fleet of vehicles with the adaptability to undertake a range of missions from similar platforms, among other goals.\\n“Part of the thinking in governments, particularly the U.S. and U.K., is that you don’t necessarily need different craft to undertake a whole range of missions,” he said. “If you are looking at underwater cables and the deep Atlantic, that’s different to special forces and the littoral environment. But the investment might be better if pooled so their assets can do all those sort[s] of things. The emerging requirement is for something that can do a range of missions.”\\nThe analyst said flexibility extends to the types of platforms from which the autonomous vehicle can operate. One platform option for Cetus, and later vessels, is the multirole ocean-surveillance ships the Royal Navy is hurriedly building to meet a fast-emerging need to further protect critical national infrastructure.\\nThe ministry is initially purchasing a commercial off-the-shelf platform for its seabed warfare program, with an operational date set for 2023. The second ship in the program is currently in the concept phase, with no final decisions taken yet regarding the procurement process.\\nAs EU officials ponder their next moves in securing seabed-borne cables and pipelines, it’s becoming clear that collecting and connecting whatever data exists on undersea goings-on will be a key first step.\\nLuckily, they need not start from scratch. Private companies emplacing and operating the connections tend to have already installed the technical means to collect information on the condition of their hardware, said Kirwan, the European Defence Agency official.\\n“The number of sensors that have been developed even to date are generating huge quantities of data,” he said. That explains his agency’s appetite for novel information-processing techniques that can translate signals picked up by sensors into actionable intelligence.\\nGerman Navy chief Vice Adm. Jan Christian Kaack has made a similar case for keeping tabs on infrastructure in the country’s territorial waters of the North and Baltic seas. His idea is to integrate sensor data generated by operators, oceanic research institutions, police and the Navy into one operational picture that covers activity above and below water, a sea service spokesman told Defense News.\\n“Keeping such a picture current would help detect anomalies quickly and enable follow-up,” the spokesman added.\\nGermany has pledged to support Denmark, Norway and Sweden in protecting their critical maritime infrastructure. The Navy has turned its ships’ travel routes to and from northern naval exercises into patrols to that effect, and officials have sent P-3C Orion maritime surveillance aircraft to watch over objects off the Norwegian cost, according to the spokesman.\\nReporting by Vivienne Machi in Stuttgart, Germany; Tom Kington in Rome; Andrew Chuter in London; and Sebastian Sprenger in Washington.\\nWASHINGTON — The Army is using internal development and small-business ideas to figure out how to fire artillery faster, exploring every facet from how projectiles are stored all the way to automated reloading.\\nBrig. Gen. John Rafferty, who is in charge of Long-Range Precision Fires modernization, told Defense News in an interview ahead of the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference that he is “a little bit embarrassed” to describe to innovative small companies how the Army handles ammunition in an artillery battalion, realizing that the process hasn’t changed in over 50 years.\\n“When you evaluate the amount of time and man hours these soldiers doing these tasks, one-by-one unbanding projectiles and inspecting them one-by-one, inventorying them one-by-one,\" Rafferty said. \"What if we could automate some of those tasks? And then how much more effective that unit would be in its operational mission, if those soldiers were preparing for the next mission, were doing reconnaissance, were sleeping, eating, doing maintenance, point security,” Rafferty said. “Would that unit be available for missions rather than be out because it has to resupply?”\\nThe Army has teed up three lines of effort to tackle the entire chain of handling ammunition, loading and reloading in order to fire faster.\\nWhile capability garnered from these efforts could feed into current weapons, they will also be incorporated into the Extended Range Cannon Artillery system that the service is planning to deliver to the force in 2023, according to Rafferty.\\nThat programs aims to increase the range and lethality of artillery, but will also have an increased rate of fire.\\nWhile the Army is busy determining which operational units will first get the new weapon, and how many of them, officials are also reconfiguring the existing architecture of its original prototype autoloader “to get one that’s a little bit easier to integrate but reducing the capacity,” Rafferty said.\\nThe design effort for that is “on track” at the Army’s Combat Capabilities Development Command Armaments Center, he said. “We’ll see a demonstration of that capability next year.”\\nThe second line of effort is being managed out of Army Futures Command’s Army Applications Lab which turned to small business innovators to figure out a way to increase the rate of fire of self-propelled howitzers.\\nThrough the lab, the Army launched the program using a Small Business Innovation Research-based (SIBR) Special Program Awards for Required Technology Needs (SPARTN) contracting mechanism.\\nThe program is in the solicitation phase, Rafferty said, but seeks to attract small business to come in and map the interior process of the Howitzer and figure out where automation can be applied to help improve the rate of fire in other ways besides the autoloader the Army is developing internally.\\nThe Army anticipates closing the solicitation phase over the next six weeks, Rafferty said, with a plan to select up to 15 small businesses to develop concepts over a short period of time. The service would then down-select to a smaller number to go into a prototyping phase, he said.\\n“The SIBR program is fantastic for casting a wide net and then bringing in and carrying enough forward for a short period of time at not an enormous expense,” Rafferty said.\\nWhile the SPARTN Fire Faster effort is focused on the interior of the Howitzer, the Army is also tapping into other small businesses to help solve handling artillery through automation across the logistics chain.\\nThe Army picked six companies to work on ways to improve the currently cumbersome, taxing and sometimes risky munitions resupply system for field artillery units operating M109 Paladin howitzers at the beginning of 2020.\\nThe Army has since down-selected to three companies who are working to deliver prototypes as part of the Field Artillery Autonomous Resupply (FAAR) effort, also being run through the Army Applications Lab. Those companies are working closely with operational units throughout the effort, Rafferty said.\\nApptronik, a robotics company spun out of the Human Centered Robotics Lab at the University of Texas at Austin, is developing a “remarkably innovative” robotic arm to help with moving projectiles, Rafferty said.\\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Carnegie Robotics, which specializes in robotic sensors and platforms, and Actuate, which has developed artificial intelligence focused on computer vision software, are both working on “delivering a component to help us with ammunition inventory, inspection and management and visibility,” Rafferty said.\\nThe companies are tackling how to take a very manual process that currently involves a clipboard, pen and paper and automate that system.\\nFor example, on a Paladin howitzer, the section chief has to punch the number of projectiles and number of fuses by type and lot number into the automated fire control system, Rafferty said. “It’s a very complicated process,” he said, “and let’s be honest, we don’t really do that very well.”\\nRafferty said, “You can only imagine how having an automated system, which we don’t have, for having visibility of [the loading process] will help with the sustainment and the resupply.”\\nThe hope is to line up the capability developed through the Field Artillery Autonomous Resupply cohort and the SPARTN effort with the first platoon getting the new Extended Range Cannon Artillery weapon and see how it shakes out with the soldiers, according to Rafferty.\\n“We would have a chance to get a real comparison, a real evaluation of how it works, how it affects the operational concept, how it improves, or what its effect on the sustainment functions in our sustainment teams are; so that’s sort of the vision for that,” he said. \"We’ve got a long way to go to get there.”\\nWASHINGTON — The Air Force’s budget for fiscal 2023 calls for cutting 150 aircraft, including older A-10 Warthogs, F-22A Raptors, T-1 Jayhawks, and KC-135 Stratotankers.\\nThe Air Force would also buy fewer F-35As and HH-60W Jolly Green II combat rescue helicopters under the proposed 2023 budget released Monday.\\nAnd it would provide more funding for the B-21 Raider bomber, hypersonics, the Next Generation Air Dominance program and the replacement for the aging E-3 Sentry, known as the Airborne Warning and Control System.\\nThe Department of the Air Force’s proposed budget, including both the Air Force and Space Force, would grow to $194 billion, a nearly 7% increase from the approximately $182 billion approved for 2022. The Air Force’s portion of that budget would be about $169.5 billion.\\nThe bulk of that growth would go to increased spending on research, development, testing and evaluation; procurement; and operations and maintenance, as part of the Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles “CQ” Brown’s directive to “accelerate change or lose.”\\nThe requested RDT&E spending alone would increase by $9 billion, including funding for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, NGAD and the B-21 family of systems.\\nAir Force Secretary Frank Kendall said in a March 25 briefing with reporters this budget shows the “transformation that we’re trying to achieve,” to deal with the changing threat environment.\\nWhile Russia remains an “acute concern” and North Korea, Iran and violent extremist groups are still a threat, Kendall said, the budget is primarily focused on China and its rapidly modernizing military as the “pacing challenge.”\\nAnd the Air Force aims to lay the groundwork for further changes in the 2024 budget, he added.\\nKendall said the Air Force had to make “hard choices” about slimming down its aircraft fleet, although the proposed retirements are not as steep as the more than 200 the service asked for last year.\\n“We have to get rid of, what I’ll call legacy equipment in order to have the resources to modernize,” Kendall said.\\nThe Air Force is taking another swing at retiring some A-10 Thunderbolt II attack planes. The proposed 2023 budget aims to cut 21 Air National Guard A-10s at Fort Wayne, Indiana, and transition that squadron to the same number of F-16s.\\nKendall said he hopes retirement will not be controversial — but the A-10 has survived past attempts to trim its fleet. The service sought to cut 42 A-10s in 2022, but Congress ultimately blocked those retirements in the National Defense Authorization Act, while allowing all other retirements the Air Force sought.\\nWhile some have called for transferring A-10s — originally designed to destroy columns of Russian tanks invading Europe during the Cold War — to Ukraine, Kendall said that war has indirectly shown how the Warthog is outdated and due for retirement.\\nUkraine’s ground-based tactical air defenses have proven to be devastatingly effective against Russia, Kendall said, keeping them from achieving air superiority and conducting aerial operations. The A-10, while rugged, is slow and vulnerable to those types of defenses.\\n“While the A-10, from a point of view of delivering munitions, would be terrific for killing Russian tanks, etc., its survivability would be in question,” Kendall said. “That’s one of the reasons that we need to move beyond the A-10, because we’re worried about high-end threats now. We’re not worried about the same threats we were worried about, at least to the same degree, when we were doing counterinsurgencies or counterterrorism.”\\nThe Air Force also plans to cut 33 Block 20 F-22 fighters, which Kendall said are now mainly being used for training purposes and aren’t combat-capable.\\nMaj. Gen. James Peccia, the Air Force’s deputy assistant secretary for budget, said it would take $1.8 billion over eight years to get those F-22s ready for combat, making it prohibitively expensive. The Air Force will instead take $1.5 billion that would have gone toward those F-22s and redirect it to modifying F-35s and modernizing other F-22s, he said. The Air Force said some of those funds will also go toward the NGAD family of systems.\\n“We will take operational jets and use them for training, but we can also take them and use them in the fight,” Peccia said. “It’s really using every dollar as smart as we can in our fighter portfolio, when we’re trying to modernize that portfolio.”\\nThe Air Force now has 186 F-22s, of which 36 are Block 20s. The Raptor fleet would end up at 153 if all retirements are approved. Kendall said he doesn’t anticipate further F-22 retirements in the future until the NGAD is ready to replace it.\\nThe Air Force asked for almost $1.7 billion for NGAD in 2023, including $133 million in RDT&E funding.\\nThe Air Force is also planning to transfer 100 of its more than 300 MQ-9 Reapers to “another government organization,” Kendall said. Such language is typically used to describe the CIA or other clandestine government organizations.\\nThe MQ-9s are physically staying where they are, Peccia said; he would not specify to whom they are being transferred.\\nThe steepest cuts to individual fleets, as a percentage, will come to the aging E-8 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, or JSTARS, and E-3 Sentry. The Air Force would retire eight of its JSTARS at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia in 2023, and the final four JSTARS would be retired in fiscal 2024, completing the fleet’s divestment. The first four JSTARS retirements are planned for this fiscal year.\\nThe Air Force would also retire 15 E-3s from Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma.\\nThis would be about half the service’s 31 E-3s, and the Air Force would use that funding to procure and field a successor. The budget would provide $227 million in new funding for the E-3 recapitalization.\\nKendall said the Air Force will make a decision “within the next several months” on which aircraft will replace the E-3, but acknowledged Boeing’s E-7 Wedgetail is “the leading candidate, quite obviously.” Before the service makes a decision, Kendall said it will have to look at its requirements and conduct market research to do its “due diligence.”\\nBoth the AWACS and JSTARS fleets are “aging out” and need to be replaced, Kendall said.\\nThe Air Force said the proposed 2023 funding for an E-3 replacement would pay for a rapid prototype aircraft, once a choice has been made, that would be delivered in fiscal 2027. The Air Force also hopes to get funding for a second prototype in 2024, and a decision on production in fiscal 2025.\\nPeccia added that both aircraft would be extremely vulnerable in a future, high-end fight, and need to be replaced with more survivable planes.\\nThe Air Force also wants to retire 10 older C-130H Hercules transport aircraft at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. With the arrival of four new C-130J Super Hercules, that would bring the service’s entire C-130 fleet from 279 to 271.\\nThose retired C-130Hs would be replaced with MC-139 Grey Wolf helicopters, of which the Air Force hopes to buy five in 2023.\\nAnd the Air Force wants to retire 50 of the service’s 177 T-1 Jayhawk twin-engine jet trainers because, Kendall said, the service is changing its approach to multi-engine training.\\nThe Air Force said new training concepts such as Undergraduate Pilot Training 2.5 — which uses more technology like immersive virtual reality training, virtual instruction and remote learning — will allow the service to phase out the T-1 for students learning to fly mobility aircraft.\\nAnd the service said advancements in the T-6 Texan will make it possible for students to learn on a single aircraft, allowing it to mothball some of the least-capable T-1s instead of replacing their engines.\\nAs the Air Force brings on more KC-46 Pegasus tankers, it hopes to retire 13 Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard KC-135s in 2023. Four of those would come from March Air Reserve Base in California, and nine would come from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey.\\nThe service wants to add $222 million to procure 15 KC-46 Pegasus tankers, up one from the 14 in last year’s proposed budget.\\nKendall suggested the Air Force might buy more KC-46s for its KC-Y bridge tanker procurement. The service is still a few months away from deciding how to proceed on acquiring its future tanker, he said, and needs to do more research.\\nBut as the service looked closer at what it needs for the tanker of the future, Kendall said the requirements “started to look like a modified KC-46, more than they do a completely new design.”\\n“I think that there’s still a possibility of a competition out there,” Kendall said. “But as we’ve looked at our requirements, the likelihood of a competition has come down.”\\nThe Air Force wants $2.7 billion to add 24 F-15EX fighters in 2023, twice the number of fighters it originally asked for in 2022. Congress eventually authorized the Air Force to buy 17 F-15EXs this year.\\nPeccia said the Air Force hopes to continue the accelerated purchase of F-15EXs over the next few years, as it retires the older C and D models of the fourth-generation fighter by fiscal 2026.\\nAnd the Air Force wants to buy 33 F-35As, fewer than the 48 the service asked for last year.\\nKendall said the Air Force trimmed its F-35A purchases to free up funds for developing NGAD, continue working on an advanced engine for the F-35 and roll out the F-15EX as quickly as possible.\\nAdding more F-15EXs will allow the service to more quickly replace aging F-15Cs, Kendall said. The F-15EX can carry more weapons than the F-35, making it well-suited to homeland defense and some defensive counter-air missions overseas.\\nBAE Systems is teaming up with Elbit Systems of America to develop combat vehicle technology, according to an Oct. 21 BAE statement.\\n“The arrangement is focused on validating and integrating new technologies on combat vehicle systems to deliver advanced warfighting capabilities,” the statement reads.\\nOn the eve of the start of the Army’s second attempt to hold a competition to replace its Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle with an Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV), the announcement could signal BAE’s plans to take a shot in the new effort.\\nBAE Systems — Bradley’s manufacturer — opted out of the previous OMFV competitive effort because the company felt the requirements and timeline to design, develop and field a new vehicle wasn’t realistic.\\nAnd the Army ended up withdrawing its first solicitation in that competition because just one competitor was able to deliver a physical bid sample within the required timeline.\\nBAE has been quiet about whether it plans to invest its time and money into the new OMFV competition, but a partnership with Elbit, which is a leader in advanced turret solutions, could be a sign that it will participate this time around.\\n“The teaming arrangement will explore crew automation, vehicle protection systems and other defensive and offensive systems for integration into turrets of various cannon calibers and supporting weapon systems for combat vehicles,” according to the statement.\\n“BAE Systems and Elbit America are investing in transformational combat vehicle technologies and turret solutions that will greatly enhance the lethality and survivability of next-generation combat vehicles for the U.S. and international militaries,” Jim Miller, director of business development at BAE Systems, said. “Our relationship demonstrates a commitment to provide our customers with solutions for future battlefields based on our collective combat vehicle expertise.”\\nThe day before the announcement, Rheinmetall put out a statement saying it was teaming with Textron Systems to pitch its Lynx41 vehicle for the OMFV competition.\\nRheinmetall made an unsuccessful attempt last year to enter the OMFV competition with Raytheon as a US-based partner, but said it was unable to get its single Lynx vehicle in existence to the United States by the Army’s due date to deliver a physical bid sample.\\nGeneral Dynamics Land Systems is also expected to compete in the OMFV competition. It was the only company to deliver physical bid sample in the last go-around. The Army is not requiring a bid sample in the new OMFV competition.\\nThe Army put out a draft solicitation in July and plans to release its request for proposals to industry in December.\\nThe service plans to request whitepapers and then choose five prime contractor teams to design rough digital prototypes. The service will then award up to three contracts for a detailed design and prototype phase that will include options for low-rate initial production. One vendor will be selected to go into production.\\nSTUTTGART, Germany — NATO is creating organizations within the alliance that can harness dual-use technologies in critical areas such as artificial intelligence, space, quantum computing and biotechnology for defense.\\nThe alliance introduced two entities this year that are meant to support startups and academic institutions working on so-called emerging and disruptive technologies: the Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, or DIANA, with headquarters both on the European and North American continents; and the opt-in, venture capital-backed NATO Innovation Fund, or NIF.\\nBoth are expected to launch next year, and NATO has already completed much of the “difficult work” in standing up the accelerator and the fund in anticipation of that milestone, according to David van Weel, NATO’s assistant secretary general for emerging security challenges, who spoke to Defense News in an exclusive interview.\\nDIANA will connect NATO to organizations working on emerging and disruptive technologies as well as the deep-tech field through so-called challenge programs, and via partnerships with more than 75 accelerators and test centers in member nations.\\nThis year, NATO members agreed to the tech accelerator’s charter, an internal document and constitution of sorts that lays out the accelerator as a separate NATO entity and outlines its legal and financial framework.\\nA board of governors, including members of academia, the private sector and government, will oversee DIANA. The board met for the first time in October and approved a budget for 2023, van Weel said. He declined to provide a budget number, but did say he got “everything I wanted.”\\nVan Weel serves as DIANA’s interim managing director as NATO interviews candidates for a permanent leader, a process that could conclude by year’s end, he said.\\nThe initial challenge programs, in which competitors will work to solve real-world problems such as operating in a GPS-denied environment, are expected to start around April. The goal is to run three programs per year, and member nations are identifying which technologies to feature, van Weel said.\\nDIANA will be what NATO calls a “joint-funded” entity, he added, meaning member nations have the flexibility to invest in the accelerator through their finance or innovation organizations, and not just through the ministries of foreign affairs or defense budgets.\\nThe goal is to have the managing director, and DIANA itself, distanced from Brussels, he said. NATO previously announced it will have two headquarters: a European-centric location at Imperial College London, and a North American hub in Canada at a location yet to be determined.\\nWhile all NATO countries are involved in DIANA, about three-quarters of its members were involved in developing the NATO Innovation Fund’s legal framework and agreed to provide initial funding, with the goal of investing €1 billion (U.S. $1.04 billion) into tech startups over the next 15 years.\\nNATO is now recruiting for an investment team and board of directors for the accelerator.\\n“We’re basically starting a company where the nations, as limited partners, exert their control over the general partner, which will do the actual day-to-day investments,” van Weel said.\\nInitial investments should begin in 2023, after an investment team is selected and final agreements are signed. The idea is for NIF to take a minority stake in companies and to coordinate other private capital that may, for now, be more hesitant to take risk on these early-stage or dual-use startups, van Weel explained.\\nFor optimum success, NATO needs to bring in investors who have both defense and investment experience, rather than select a big-name firm that is more of a generalist, said Nicholas Nelson, a senior fellow with the Transatlantic Defense and Security program at the Center for European Policy Analysis.\\n“With regard to the dual-use and deep-tech industry, which is what DIANA and the NIF are supposed to be targeting, you need people who have experience, yes, on the investment front, but who also understand the national security environment and defense,” he told Defense News.\\nTwenty-two nations are involved in the innovation fund: Belgium; Bulgaria; the Czech Republic; Denmark; Estonia; Germany; Greece; Hungary; Iceland; Italy; Latvia; Lithuania; Luxembourg; the Netherlands; Norway; Poland; Portugal; Romania; Slovakia; Spain; Turkey; and the United Kingdom.\\nThe United States, Canada and France are notable exceptions to that list, but are likely in a “wait-and-see” mode regarding the fund and want to ensure it won’t duplicate existing efforts within their own ecosystems, Nelson said.\\nWhile van Weel lauded the speed with which NATO has launched DIANA and the innovation fund in less than a year, he acknowledged work remains to set up practical elements, such as websites containing guidance for companies and investors interested in challenge programs.\\nAs NATO races to stand up DIANA and NIF, their true value will only emerge once tangible capabilities are developed — otherwise they may end up as “just a bunch of PR wins,” Nelson said. The ultimate challenge for DIANA will be to focus on capabilities and tech areas that the entire alliance agrees upon, he noted, while NIF will, at least for now, require fewer member partners to come to agreement.\\nNelson credited NATO for getting all its members to focus on the emerging and disruptive technology landscape. Trying to wrangle 30 allies — and likely two more soon — is no easy feat, “so it’s good that they got everybody on the same page,” he said.\\nAs of press time, two NATO members — Hungary and Turkey — have not formally agreed to Sweden’s and Finland’s accession to the alliance. The Nordic countries, already longtime allies and partners to NATO, are undergoing preparations for their membership in the meantime.\\nVan Weel said they’ve been “present at the [emerging and disruptive technologies] table as invitees” to ensure a seamless integration once the accession process is complete. As full NATO members, they will automatically be part of the DIANA ecosystem. But given NIF is an opt-in fund, “they will have to make up their mind whether or not they want to join as they become members,” he explained.\\nInnovative programs as well as emerging and disruptive technologies have long been part of both military and industrial capability development in Sweden, though the nation lacks a designated agency within the defense sector for this area, said Lars Elfvin, deputy director for acquisition, research and development at Sweden’s Defence Ministry.\\n“The increasingly important, or decisive, commitment from civil and dual-use technology development and actors in the development of military capability is of utmost importance, and in Sweden we naturally follow the work that takes place within the EU and NATO in the area of innovation,” he told Defense News in an email.\\nStockholm is closely following multilateral efforts to bolster dual-use tech for defense, he added. “However, it should be emphasized that when and where Sweden decides to pursue technological breakthroughs, it can go in different directions depending on evaluation based on case-by-case considerations.”\\nFinland’s Defence Ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the nation’s potential role in NATO science and technology efforts.\\nDIANA and NIF would both benefit from Finland’s and Sweden’s inclusion in NATO, Nelson said. Both nations have strong startup ecosystems, as well as long-standing traditional industry and manufacturing players such as Sweden’s Saab and Finland’s Patria. Stockholm and Helsinki are active in the space and analytics domains, with the Swedish Space Corp. and Finnish microsatellite manufacturer ICEYE as notable players.\\nThey will also bring in new testing opportunities, particularly in the High North, Nelson said. For example, NATO would have increased access to the Esrange Space Center, a rocket range and research center in northern Sweden operated by the Swedish Space Corp.\\n“You also are bringing in two highly educated populaces that have significant training and development around both military capabilities and tech sectors writ large, that will benefit both the innovation ecosystem, including DIANA, and potentially the innovation fund … if once they join, they choose to go down that road,” Nelson said.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Army is preparing to select an existing field artillery battalion to receive the first Extended Range Cannon Artillery system, according to Brig. Gen. John Rafferty, who is in charge of the service’s long-range precision fires modernization efforts.\\nFielding will take place in 2023, but the Army will have to announce the unit with enough time to carry out a yearlong operational assessment, he said at the Association of the U.S. Army’s Global Force Next virtual event on March 16. The assessment will be critical for working through “the operational concept for how we fight with general support artillery fires and a division,” he said.\\nAt the same time, the Army is synchronizing the delivery of ammunition to include propellant and course-correcting fuses for the operational assessment, he added.\\nThe service plans to deliver real-time soldier feedback to the engineers who are working on the next battalion set of ERCA systems.\\nThe Army will also evaluate concepts of sustainment during the assessment because “this really will impact a division’s ability to sustain and especially the fires war-fighting function, which we have already put a lot of pressure on our sustainment and logistics partners,” Rafferty noted.\\nThe ERCA cannon hit a target 43 miles away — or 70 kilometers — on the nose at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, in December 2020 using an Excalibur extended-range guided artillery shell.\\nThe Army is racing to extend artillery ranges on the battlefield to take away advantages of high-end adversaries like Russia and China. The ERCA weapon, when fielded, should be able to fire at and destroy targets from a position out of the range of enemy systems.\\nThe ERCA system takes an M109A7 Paladin Integrated Management howitzer chassis and replaces the 39-caliber gun tube with a 58-caliber, 30-foot one. Combined with Raytheon-made Excalibur munitions and an XM1113 using supercharged propellant, the Army has been able to dramatically boost artillery ranges.\\nThe path to fielding ERCA at this point, Rafferty said, is “not without risk.”\\n“But our team — we work together every single day to knock these problems down. Things like the rotating band — the copper rotating band on our traditional artillery projectiles — works great for a 20-foot gun tube, but when you add 10 feet to that gun tube, we found that that was causing excessive wear and getting some engraving on the side of the projectiles,” he said.\\nThe Army team acknowledged the issue, according to Rafferty, and developed a new rotating band “in pretty short order.”\\nRafferty said he anticipates the road ahead will still feature these types of hurdles but that the team is prepared to work through them.\\nFollowing the big shot in December, Rafferty said the coming year will be full of decisions, during which the Army needs to start “snapping the chalk line on a few things. We will snap the chalk line on the propellant, we will snap the chalk line on the projectile design and begin to look towards manufacturability, towards production.”\\nThe Army will continue its soldier-centered design effort to ensure the configurations for the propellant and charge are things the soldiers can handle and that they don’t affect the rate of fire, he added. The configuration of projectiles and propellant also has to be optimally stowed in a howitzer to maximize the number of kills onboard.\\nAs the ERCA program transitions to a fielded system, Rafferty said, the Army will move the system from Army Combat Capabilities Development Command at the Armament Center to the program manager for self-propelled howitzers.\\n“As I told the chief of staff of the Army recently, it’s kind of symbolic, right? But it’s an important step to transition it, but really we go to that supportive, supporting relationship,” Rafferty said.\\nThe Armament Center and industry partners will continue the process of testing and fixing all the way to delivering the ERCA cannon in 2023.\\nThe Army is also working on a government-designed autoloader for ERCA and plans to host a live-fire test for that at Yuma Proving Ground at the end of March.\\nPARIS – In what many are calling an important shift in Italy’s mentality on arming unmanned aircraft systems, Leonardo showcased for the first time its Falco Xplorer drone fitted with an MBDA Brimstone missile at the Paris Air Show.\\nItalian defense company Leonardo has been in the business of producing UAS for two decades, and today some sixty units of its Falco drones are in use worldwide. The company has in the past advertised its systems primarily for civilian operations as well as intelligence and surveillance-based missions. This has in part reflected a tendency that has existed in the broader Italian defense culture over time, which could somewhat be considered as a resistance or even taboo towards arming these types of systems.\\nThis could be changing as Leonardo displayed its light medium-altitude long endurance, or MALE, drone, the Falco Xplorer, mounted with MBDA’s lightweight Brimstone missile at the Paris Air Show, going on this week. Although only one was visible, a company representative told Defense News that it could be fitted with a total of four missiles.\\n“MBDA and Leonardo are cooperating together on integrating Brimstone on the Falco Xplorer and are also currently doing joint integration studies and demonstrations,” the representative said.\\nThe ambition is to have this variant available on the market for customers by 2025. It was not developed in response to a requirement issued specifically by the Italian Air Force, rather responding to a demand by other customers, they said.\\nThe FALCO Xplorer has a maximum payload of 350 kilograms (772 lbs) and has an endurance of 24 hours.\\nConcerning potential sales, it is likely to peak the interest of existing Brimstone operators. Beyond the U.K., the missiles have in the past been sold to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Germany and most recently Ukraine for use as a surface-launched ground attack system. The Spanish Air Force also selected the weapon earlier this year to equip its fleet of Eurofighters.\\nPARIS — The French military has selected Nexter to develop new drones equipped with anti-tank warheads for the army, with a goal to demonstrate the new capability by the end of 2024, the company announced June 19.\\nThe French Defense Innovation Agency – an agency similar to the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) – signed a contract with Nexter on June 16 to build a new medium-range, remotely operated munition under the “Larinae” project, which was launched in early May. Larinae is Latin for seagull.\\nNexter and its partners’ proposed solution includes an unmanned aerial system (UAS) manufactured by French vendor EOS Technologie, along with core-generating charge technology produced by Nexter, and a GPS-independent navigation system capable of operating in contested environments from startup TRAAK. It’s intended to have a range of at least 80 kilometers (nearly 50 miles) and to remain autonomous for three hours.\\nThe French defense ministry declined to give a price tag for the project.\\nNexter – which is part of the European land defense systems group KNDS alongside Germany’s Krauss-Maffei Wegmann – touted the munition’s proposed ability to “thwart” active defenses of armored vehicles before piercing their armor. It will also contain an optronic ball capable of detecting vehicles 15 kilometers away by day, three kilometers by night, and which allows operators to observe terrain from afar.\\nThe French Armed Forces have put a premium on developing a low-cost unmanned solution that can target and neutralize an armored vehicle between 5 and 50 kilometers away. Larinae focuses on the higher end of that distance, and a second project, “Colibri” – or Hummingbird – focuses on the lower end.\\nLoitering munitions have received renewed attention from militaries since being used by both Azerbaijan and Armenia in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in 2020, and for their use by Ukraine in their ongoing defense against Russian forces.\\nFrance first announced an interest in procuring U.S.-built loitering munitions in 2022 as a transitional capability while the Larinae and Colibri projects move forward. This past April, U.S. unmanned systems manufacturer Aerovironment announced it had received a $64 million contract to provide its Switchblade 300 drone to the U.S. Army, and that the contract included foreign military sales for the capability to France “for the first time,” as well as to “another allied nation.” Those drones are scheduled to be delivered in 2024. Aerovironment has supplied the Switchblade 300 to the U.S. Army for over a decade.\\nThe French government’s proposed military budget for the 2024-2030 period includes €5 billion ($5.5 billion) for unmanned systems. The budget is currently being deliberated by the French Senate, and has already been passed by the government’s lower body, the General Assembly.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Army has picked five small business innovators to build prototypes intended to help increase the rate of fire of self-propelled howitzers as well as in future systems, Brig. Gen. John Rafferty, who is in charge of the service’s Long-Range Precision Fires modernization efforts, told Defense News on April 15.\\nThe SPARTN Fire Faster project is one of three lines of effort in which the Army is engaged to increase the rate of fire and smooth out the process of loading artillery pieces.\\nSPARTN stands for Small Business Innovation Research-based (SIBR) Special Program Awards for Required Technology Needs, which is the contracting mechanism used to launch the program.\\nHow the Army handles ammunition in an artillery battalion hasn’t changed in over 50 years, a fact that leaves Rafferty “a little bit embarrassed,” according to a previous interview with Defense News.\\nThe five small businesses who will continue on in the program, chosen from a larger pool generated from a solicitation posted last year, are Austin, Texas-based ARM Automation; CR Tactical in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; San Diego, California-based Dynovas; H.A. Eckhart in Lansing, Michigan; and another Pittsburgh-based company, RE2 Robotics.\\nCR Tactical, a spinout of Carnegie Robotics, specializes in robotic sensors and platforms. Carnegie Robotics is one of three companies involved in the Army’s Field Artillery Autonomous Resupply (FAAR) effort being run through the Army Applications Lab.\\nWhile Fire Faster is focused on the interior of the Howitzer, FAAR is helping to solve handling artillery through automation across the logistics chain. The Army picked six companies to work on the effort at the beginning of 2020 and down-selected to three companies who are working to deliver prototypes.\\nWhile the Army cannot disclose the specific technology each company has pitched, ARM Automation, since 1993, has been focused on automated manufacturing solutions for a variety of industries, and CR Tactical is focused on robotic sensors and systems used across a variety of applications from defense to agriculture to mining among others.\\nDynovas has been working in both the aerospace and defense fields developing mechanical and munitions handling systems for over 30 years.\\nH.A. Eckhart is a company with experience in robotics and automation as well as 3D printing and additive manufacturing. It was established in 1974.\\nUsing intelligent mobile robotics, RE2 Robotics’ speciality is helping organizations improve worker safety, productivity and efficiency.\\nIn this phase of the program, the companies will have 24 months to further develop concepts and detailed designs although some may finish as early as 18 months depending on the project, Rafferty said. Companies could receive up to $2.5 million in contracts or matching funds.\\nThe Army will continue to use soldiers and users to offer frequent feedback to the developers throughout the process, he said, with resulting prototype technology that is proven at a component level or at a system level in expected operational environments.\\nAt the end of the period, the service will evaluate prototype performance to determine next steps.\\nWhile Rafferty could not discuss specific reasons why each company was chosen, he said a panel of evaluators, using a process that eliminates bias, looked at a number of criteria to make determinations.\\nThe panel focused on “concept maturity, feasibility and the impact to reducing the rate of fire,” Rafferty said.\\nThe Army took pains to map its entire logistics and operational process to fire artillery in great detail for the companies involved. Once the companies fully understood that process, they had to clearly articulate how their technologies would impact that process, according to Rafferty.\\nIn addition to the Fire Faster and FAAR efforts, the Army is also working on its own, internally developed autoloader intended to be integrated into its Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) system in development.\\nRafferty told Defense News last year the service was reconfiguring the existing architecture of its original prototype autoloader by reducing its capacity in order to make it easier to integrate.\\nAt the end of March, the Army demonstrated the original, full-capacity design at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona. Rafferty said it was a “very impressive” event and a “real engineering feat that our Armaments Center should be very proud of.”\\nThe Army “wanted to take it all the way to this demo to do a couple of things,” he said, “and it was to validate the software, the hardware and to improve the model that we have been using to develop the technology and integrate it into the howitzer.”\\nA 23-round autoloader is the objective, reduced-capacity system that the Army is continuing to mature. Rafferty said he expects a fully integrated demonstration later this year.\\n“The original design proved really too cumbersome and too many trades for mobility and survivability and reliability that we weren’t willing to make,” Rafferty said, “so scaling that thing down to 23 rounds, like I said, using the existing architecture. It wasn’t a clean sheet.”\\nThe demonstration of the 23-round autoloader coming this year is reliant on the same hardware infrastructure and software used in March.\\nWhile the Army had planned previously to deliver a prototype in 2024, Rafferty said that is no longer a “viable option for us anymore, and that’s okay.”\\nThe guidance the service received from senior leaders, he said, was to prioritize range and lethality with the ERCA system and then “rate of fire when we are ready with the right alternative to provide soldiers and units in the field.”\\nThe Army hasn’t changed its approach, Rafferty said. “We want to make sure we get it right.”\\nIn this case that means scaling the capacity of the autoloader down to 23 rounds as the “sweet spot for weight and center of gravity and on-board kills.”\\nThrough the effort “we learned a lot,” he noted. “We know what it is going to take for the ERCA platform to be successful.”\\nWASHINGTON — U.S. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall is having second thoughts about the Pentagon’s decision to upgrade the F-35 fighter jet’s current engines instead of developing a next-generation replacement.\\nIn a discussion at the McAleese & Associates conference in Washington, Kendall said the decision to upgrade the fighters’ current Pratt & Whitney-made F135 engines instead of developing a new adaptive engine “was the right decision, given the constraints that we have, but [a choice] that I worry about a little bit.”\\n“If we had the opportunity to reconsider that, I think that would be something I’d like to have another shot at,” Kendall said. “Right now, it’s unaffordable. The only service that wants the new technology is the Air Force right now, and we can’t afford it by ourselves.”\\nThe F-35 is scheduled to receive a series of significant upgrades in the coming years known as the block 4 modernization effort, which will include the ability to carry more weapons, better recognize targets and conduct advanced electronic warfare. But to handle those upgrades — which F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin said will introduce about 518 capabilities — the military says the fighter will need much greater power and cooling abilities.\\nSince 2016, the Air Force has allocated nearly $2.7 billion for the Adaptive Engine Transition Program, which sought to fund research, development, prototyping and testing of a new kind of engine intended to provide greater thrust, power and cooling abilities. The adaptive engine model uses three streams of air for greater cooling, and has an adaptive cycle that would allow it to switch to the most efficient configuration for any given situation.\\nGeneral Electric Aviation and Pratt & Whitney each developed adaptive engines as part of AETP — the XA100 and XA101, respectively. But while GE pitched its XA100 as a replacement for the F-35, Pratt said an upgrade of the current engines — which it calls the Engine Core Upgrade — would be a more cost-efficient option that would work on all F-35s.\\nUltimately, the Air Force announced in its budget briefings March 10 and 13 that the military would not transition AETP to a program of record, and would instead go with the F135 upgrade.\\nThe potential cost of an adaptive engine, which Kendall last year pegged at more than $6 billion, proved a major sticking point. So did doubts over whether it could be made to fit in the Marine Corps’ F-35B, which has an engine that swivels down to allow the jet to vertically land. While GE said it had found a way to make its engine work in the F-35B, the Pentagon was apparently skeptical.\\nInstalling an adaptive engine into “the Marine Corps variant was going to be very, very difficult, if not impossible,” Kendall said in the March 10 budget briefing with reporters at the Pentagon.\\nKendall also called the adaptive engine “a really good fit” for the Air Force’s F-35A variant on March 10.\\nAnd at Wednesday’s McAleese conference, he expanded further on what made an AETP engine attractive to the service noting that the adaptive engine would have provided more fuel efficiency than the F135 Engine Core Upgrade.\\nHe explained the adaptive engine’s greater fuel efficiency would have translated to less fuel burned and more cost savings, plus extended range, which he described as a “really attractive” benefit — a handy capability in a fight in the large Pacific region.\\nKendall said it also would have introduced competition into the F-35 engine market, which Raytheon Technologies-owned Pratt & Whitney has dominated.\\nIf the Air Force were to decide to go it alone on AETP, Kendall said, it would be a multiyear, multibillion-dollar program — one that would have been out of the service’s reach. “It’s a major lift, and you just can’t do everything,” he added.\\nThe Air Force plans to roll some of the technologies developed as part of AETP into its Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion program, which aims to produce similarly advanced engines for its future sixth-generation fighter known as Next Generation Air Dominance.\\n“The AETP technology advanced the state of the art,” Kendall said. “So we’re going to benefit from that indirectly.”\\nWASHINGTON — The request for proposals from industry for the U.S. Army’s optionally manned fighting vehicle, or OMFV, intended to replace the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, has hit the street and allows for greater flexibility for foreign companies to compete.\\nIn the service’s second stab at holding a competition for OMFV, the Army is driving as much flexibility as it can across the board, from avoiding stringent requirements in favor of loose characteristics and creating a phase for industry to design concepts without much company investment that will form requirements along the way.\\nThe Army’s previous attempt required the delivery of physical bid samples, which hamstrung foreign competitor Rheinmetall of Germany and drove Bradley-maker BAE Systems to avoid the competition. Ultimately, the service received just one bid sample from General Dynamics Land Systems, which forced the Army to rethink the effort and come back with a new approach.\\nThe OMFV competition has foreign industry jumping to join in with new and modernized platforms, and the Army appears to be ditching much of the restrictions that would typically keep them out.\\nRheinmetall has already partnered with American firms Raytheon and Textron to solidify its participation in the competition, but many other companies are poised to submit bids to design concepts.\\nThe pool needs to be deep because the Army anticipates awarding up to five contracts to design platforms.\\n“The challenges we’ve typically had in getting foreign participation is we often have a lot of classified material that we release up front, and we have some detailed specification that has very detailed performance requirements that’s classified,” Brig. Gen. Glenn Dean, the new Army program executive officer for ground combat systems, said in a Dec. 18 press briefing.\\nForeign competitors “have to have clearances in place to be able to take that information,” Dean said. This means foreign companies must either be partnered with a prime contractor in the United States, have a subsidiary stateside, or have other clearances that take time to get through the approval process in order to exchange the classified information.\\nWorking through consortiums, which the Army regularly does, also makes it hard for foreign contractors to come through the door, Dean said.\\nThis time, the Army isn’t working with a consortium and is using a more traditional federal acquisition regulation-based contract, according to Dean. Furthermore, he said, classified reports will not be required in order to submit a bid or receive an initial design contract award.\\n“We’ve eliminated the limitation on primes and, because we don’t have classified information we are providing at the front end, that allows us to share more broadly and gives those companies time if they’re going to continue to play as lead, to establish their facilities, clearances and have the necessary structures in place to receive classified information when we get to that point,” he said.\\nDean expects more classified requirements to kick in toward the end of the concept design phase where requirements begin to take shape, which translates to specifications. “Obviously, every company is going to make their own determination about what strengths and partners may bring to the table, whether they want to come in as a sub, whether they want to be prime with a bunch of U.S. subs,” Dean said, “but the response has been very promising.”\\nHe also said there is strong interest from abroad. “I would say that we at least heard from or have participation … from all the major companies in the West capable of doing a full combat vehicle. Companies from Israel, South Korea, Singapore, Germany, in addition to companies both you’re familiar with in the U.S. who’ve [supplied] combat vehicles, but also some companies that operate in the defense space but haven’t traditionally been combat vehicle suppliers,” he said. “We will see how many of them ultimately decide they want to throw their hat in the ring and participate. I think we’ve done what we need to do to make it as open at an initial point.”\\nSources following the competition are expecting to see participation from South Korea’s Hanwha, which is in a head-to-head competition in Australia with Rheinmetall to produce a new infantry fighting vehicle.\\nGermany-based Krauss-Maffei Wegmann has also touted an infantry fighting vehicle option, most recently at the last in-person Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference in Washington, D.C., in 2019.\\nBelgium’s CMI Defense is also rumored to be forging a partnership with a U.S. prime to participate in the competition.\\nNow that the solicitation has been posted to Beta.Sam.Gov, companies have until April 16, 2021, to submit a conceptual bid. The Army will award contracts in July, according to Dean, which will kick off 15 months of funded work.\\nDuring the phase, industry will work on designs without bending metal that will inform an abbreviated capabilities development document — or an initial set of requirements. Once the design phase ends, the Army will take a pause and then open the competition back up for a more detailed design effort ahead of prototyping, where up to three bids will be selected to proceed. The detailed design phase will be executed over the course of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024.\\nThe prototyping phase will begin in FY25, according to slides presented at the OMFV industry day. Vehicle testing will begin in FY26 and wrap up in FY27, with a production decision planned for the fourth quarter of FY27. Full-rate production is expected to begin in the second quarter of FY30.\\nIn parallel to the concept design phase, the Army will develop an open architecture for OMFV. An open architecture has risen to the top of the OMFV planner’s list of required capability, particularly after seeing the need to be networked with other capabilities across the battlefield and at the forward edge at Project Convergence at Yuma Proving Grounds, Arizona, over the summer. The Army will establish a voluntary consortium beginning in January 2021 that will represent industry, government and academia in order to develop such an open architecture, according to the statement.\\nWASHINGTON — The Army is testing a solution to address overheating and toxic gas production in the newest version of the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle’s turret battery, but its release has been delayed by almost a year, the service’s program office told Defense News.\\nThe problem was discovered during the Army Test and Evaluation Command-run Full Operational Test and Evaluation at Fort Hood, Texas, where the Bradley A4 batteries were hooked directly into test equipment placing additional strain on them. The Bradley A4 design features a new charger but not new batteries. The new charger did not come with a voltage regulator, which caused the older batteries to overheat and produce the toxic gas during testing.\\nThe command suspended the maneuver portion of the test due to safety concerns related to the batteries overheating in all six test articles, according to a report recently released from the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation.\\n“All six test article turret batteries overheated and discharged toxic fumes into the turret and crew compartment,” the report states. “This is a safety hazard to soldiers. The program manager was present during test and observed the turret battery issue. He supported the recommendation to suspend the remaining maneuver missions.”\\nAccording to the program office, the service is partnered with several vendors that developed Bradley A4 — BAE Systems is the prime contractor — to design and test a solution after determining the problem during the testing process.\\nThe program office now expects to receive a materiel release by January 2022 with field maintenance new equipment training and operator new equipment training beginning at the same time. The original materiel release decision was expected in third quarter of fiscal 2021, the DOT&E report stated.\\nThe first Armored Brigade Combat Team is scheduled to get its new Bradley A4s in September 2022, the Bradley program office said.\\nThe Bradley A4 is an engineering change proposal program that brings in new suspension and track upgrades and upgrades the electrical system and power train to restore lost mobility and integrate new technologies.\\nThe current Bradley, for example, struggled to take on the power needed to run an active protection system. The Bradley won’t receive an APS system until A4 is up and running.\\nThe Army reduced its Bradley modifications further in its FY21 budget request after cutting future upgrades beyond its A4 variant in FY20. The service is working to replace the Bradley down the road with an Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle program. But the Bradley and its fire support vehicle will remain in ABCT formations until the 2050s.\\nThe FY21 appropriations bill slashed the Bradley program by $161 million due to production delays.\\nWASHINGTON — GM Defense has hired Steve duMont, who has had a long career in the defense industry, most recently leading global growth for Raytheon’s intelligence and space business sector, as its new president.\\nAt Raytheon, duMont held other leadership positions over 13 years and also worked at BAE Systems and Boeing. GM’s new president served as an aviation officer and attack helicopter pilot in the U.S. Army.\\nHe replaces former president David Albritton, who went to Amazon in November 2020, after a nationwide search.\\nThree weeks into the new job, duMont celebrated the official opening of GM Defense’s new 75,000 square-foot production facility in Concord, North Carolina, where it will manufacture the U.S. Army’s Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV), the company’s first big win to provide a vehicle to the U.S. military.\\nThe ISV will be a light, all-terrain troop carrier to rapidly inject troops into the fight. The vehicle is based on its 2020 Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 truck architecture and features 90 percent commercial off-the-shelf parts.\\n“When I looked at this opportunity and, really, the ability to do something very important for our warfighter, it kind of became a no-brainer for me,” duMont told Defense News in a May 4 interview.\\nGM Defense is a fresh company in the sector, beginning in 2017, but builds off an enormously accomplished history of a major commercial vehicle supplier with defense roots dating back to World War II.\\nISV was a “tremendous win” for GM Defense, duMont said, and GM’s focus on “the future of mobility, specifically focused on battery electric power, autonomy and unmanned, manned and unmanned collaboration and connected vehicles,” drew him to the job.\\nGM plans to invest $27 billion over the next five years in those areas, duMont said, and “when I looked at the opportunity to take that investment and bring it into the defense environment and be able to bring value to our warfighters and do it at commercial speed and commercial scale, that, I think, is what really excited me.”\\nWhile at Raytheon, duMont worked closely with the Raytheon-Rheinmetall North America team on its first bid for the U.S. Army’s Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle replacement, the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle program. Ultimately, the team’s physical bid sample didn’t make it in time to be tagged in for the competition.\\nThe Army was left with just one physical bid sample from General Dynamics Land Systems. Instead of proceeding with just one player, the Army decided to take a new approach and launched a fresh competition. A team of Rheinmetall, Raytheon, Textron and L3 are competing to design an OMFV as part of the new effort.\\nIn OMFV, duMont sees a great potential for GM Defense to participate, but the company did not submit its own bid to compete for an initial design phase.\\nThe OMFV program needs companies like GM Defense to “bring new and innovative technologies to solve the toughest problems of our warfighters,” duMont said. He added that while GM is capable of going in as a prime, “we are, as an organization, probably at this point more focused on a teaming approach and that is where I think we can deliver the most value to the U.S. Army on that program.”\\nGM Defense also has its eye on the U.S. Army’s plan to re-compete for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program, of which Oshkosh Defense is currently the prime.\\nJLTV was the first program duMont mentioned specifically in his interview with Defense News. “What we want to do is bring in the same value that we brought into ISV, which is the ability to take GM’s world-class processes to design, develop and manufacture world-class vehicles and be able to scale the production capabilities,” he said.\\nGM Defense was able to build its first ISV in 120 days following contract signing and built its Concord plant in 90 days — during the coronavirus pandemic — where it will rapidly build over 2,000 of the vehicles. The plant features some of the latest manufacturing tools including a digital operating system that uses Bluetooth-enabled tools.\\nThe company also rapidly converted one of its own ISV vehicles to entirely battery electric powered variant in a number of weeks and had it available for VIP guests to drive at its Concord facility opening May 4.\\nThat battery electric powered ISV using a battery system based on the Chevy Bolt will head to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, next week so soldiers can try it out, duMont noted.\\nThe U.S. Army is working toward finding alternative power for its combat vehicles and OMFV could be a candidate for hybrid power, for instance.\\nFor OMFV, its requirement for silent watch would mean a “very intensive battery system,” duMont said, and GM can give the Army innovative options as it ventures down the battery powered electric vehicle path.\\nThe U.S. Army is also aiming to acquire an electric light reconnaissance vehicle and GM Defense is “very interested in working collaboratively with the Army” on that effort. The demonstration at Fort Benning will help the company highlight how it could contribute to that program, duMont noted.\\nAnother area of focus for GM Defense in the near term is applying its parent company’s investment in autonomy to defense capability, according to duMont, as there is no doubt the technology will play a major role on future battlefields.\\nAUSTIN, Texas — Decked out in a dark blazer, jeans and black cowboy boots, and foregoing his four stars for an understated U.S. Army lapel pin, Gen. Mike Murray, the head of Army Futures Command, asked a packed room of small business owners and entrepreneurs how many have seen a four-star general before.\\nAbout a third of the audience at the Austin Startup Week in September shot up their hands. Murray turned to a man in the front row and asked who he’d met. The man replied, “Dick Cody,” a general who retired as vice chief of staff in 2008.\\n“What about a serving four-star general,” Murray asked.\\nJust a few hands went up in the audience at the Capital Factory, an entrepreneurial hub in the heart of downtown Austin, Texas, which hosted the event.\\nFor startups and companies categorized as small, doing business with the military has been daunting and seemingly impossible to navigate without a staff full of business development experts. And historically, getting access to and communicating with senior decision-makers at the Pentagon hasn’t been easy.\\nBut as the Army tries to rapidly modernize its force following years of failures with major acquisition programs, it knows it can’t conduct business as usual with big defense firms and still get the disruptive technology or out-of-the box ideas it needs for its six modernization priorities: long-range precision fires, next-generation combat vehicle, future vertical lift, the network, air and missile defense, and soldier lethality.\\nThe Army’s billions of dollars in science and technology development funding is a big draw for startups that consider readily available cash to be their oxygen.\\nThe Army launched Army Futures Command, or AFC, roughly a year and a half ago to reform how the service develops requirements and transitions research and development efforts into programs of record. The command was also tasked to do a better job working with nontraditional companies, small businesses, startups and academia to advance modernization efforts.\\nTo improve relations with those communities and breakdown some of the traditional barriers, the new four-star command wasn’t set up on base, but rather in the heart of a city. The Army chose Austin for its vibrant startup community, creativity and close connection to the military community.\\nAFC minted relationships with the University of Texas, which agreed to give it the 15th and part of the 19th floor in one of its buildings in downtown Austin as well as access to other campus space.\\nA year ago, when the service declared initial operational capability for the command, the 19th floor was just concrete and exposed pipes with a view of the state capitol building.\\nAt the time, “the biggest challenge every day was which printer was going to work,” Murray told Defense News in an interview at AFC headquarters in September. The command had a staff of roughly 40 at the time. Now the headquarters is manned at about 75 percent strength and has just north of 26,000 people spread across 28 states in 15 countries developing concepts and working on modernization priorities.\\nBreaking down barriers\\nEstablishing the command has been a heavy lift, but perhaps the heaviest has been figuring out how to reach out to the entrepreneurial community in a systematic and effective way.\\n“A year ago I had no idea what startups were or pitches,” Murray said to a packed crowd at Austin Startup Week. “I’ve learned a lot in the first year.”\\nMurray acknowledged there is still room for improvement when it comes to how the Army works with small businesses. “We’ve gotten better, but we’re nowhere near where we need to get in terms of working with small businesses and startups. And you’re dealing with a lot of culture and a lot of bureaucracy that kind of makes us move slow — a lot slower than we need to be.”\\nEven with 37 years under his belt as a soldier, Murray admitted: “I’m not an outside-of-the box thinker.” But taking the helm of AFC is forcing the general to change his thinking.\\n“Our Army has had a terrible habit: If it wasn’t invented inside the Army, it’s not worth pursuing,” he said, “I’m constantly trying to break those barriers that we’ve got to accept some ideas and really some solutions from outside of the Army if we are to take a very analog organization and move it into the digital age.”\\nA two-way street\\nArmy leadership in Austin acknowledges that the startup community isn’t going to just come beating on its door, begging for a chance to work with the service, partly because government bureaucracy can act as a deterrent. Certainly there are hurdles when it comes to working with the military, but a major issue involves how funding flows during technology development efforts.\\nArea-I CEO Nick Alley told an audience at Austin Startup Week that one of his products — an unmanned system under evaluation by the Army’s Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team for possible applications as an air-launched effect — has no commercial application. Therefore, he explained, the company must solely rely on obtaining government funding, which doesn’t come at the pace needed to continue operations.\\nAt one point he had to borrow $10,000 from his parents to cover employee salaries.\\nThe Army also doesn’t buy things very quickly, and that has to change, Murray said, joking that if he followed the traditional defense acquisition timeline to get his daughters cellphones in 2011, they’d receive them this coming Christmas, and they’d be flip phones.\\nThe garage door is always open\\nIf you stood outside of AFC headquarters, you wouldn’t see evidence of the Army’s presence, but a plan is in the works to set up a storefront welcoming visitors to come in and learn about the command on the first floor.\\nBut the main gateway for startups to interface with the Army is the Army Applications Lab, or AAL, established over the past year.\\nThe AAL has become the face of doing business with the Army in the startup community, and it has set up shop on a floor inside the Capital Factory, only blocks away from the University of Texas.\\nWhile the command headquarters looks like a typical government office, aside from an abundance of standing desks and a complete lack of ties, the AAL speaks more to the startup world.\\nThere’s no security. Anyone can walk in through an open garage door and pitch ideas to the Army while sitting on comfortable, brown leather sofas. Nobody really has their own office, save the colonel in charge of the outfit, but even he shares his space. And jeans and T-shirts are the uniform of choice.\\n“We act as a translator and concierge service across the Army’s future force modernization enterprise and the broader commercial marketplace of ideas,” Col. Len Rosanoff, the director of the AAL, told Defense News in an interview at the factory. While he has a long career as a special operator, he could easily be confused for an enthusiastic entrepreneur.\\nThe AAL concept wasn’t easy to establish, Murray said in his interview with Defense News. “I struggled with it for probably six, seven months. They didn’t get the best guidance from me because I was trying to figure out a niche, what I really wanted them to do, because it’s so different,” he said.\\n“If I’m finding technology, then searching for a problem, I’m doing it completely backwards,” he added. The AAL is meant to help with that by bringing the Army’s top issues to the startup community in search of solutions.\\nSpeaking the same language\\nIt’s no secret that the Army and entrepreneurs speak different languages, follow different rules and work at different paces. In fact, the Army is trying to fix that.\\nThe issue was apparent to Capital Factory CEO Josh Baer when he printed the Army logo on T-shirts, only to have Army lawyers take away the shirts while they were being distributed at an event welcoming the AFC to the factory.\\nBaer ended up slapping company stickers over the logos on T-shirts people were already wearing, and then sent the shirts back to the printer so the factory’s logo could be printed over the Army’s.\\n“I didn’t even realize I had to get it approved,” Baer said. “There’s no hard feelings. It was really funny.”\\nThe day Defense News spoke with Baer, he was preparing to kick off a first-ever course — a startup academy — for government officials and big companies on how to work with startups. Baer offers similar courses for startups looking to learn how to work with the government.\\nThe AAL has taken pains to break down language and general cultural barriers with the startup world through its technology solicitation approach. AAL established an online portal in March 2018 — like a TurboTax for the Army’s broad agency announcements — where firms can submit solutions or concepts to address the service’s problems. (The Army has 15 ongoing focus areas.)\\nThe companies AAL wants to hear from likely won’t understand how to navigate the process for answering broad agency announcements. So the organization has created a series of simple questions that legally cover the process so users can provide the necessary information. A submitted entry generates a whitepaper for the Army to analyze elements such as technical viability.\\nThe Army averages about one submission a day through the portal.\\nIf the portal is deemed a success for AAL, then AFC and the Army itself might adopt the approach so external entrepreneurs and problem-solvers can better navigate the gauntlet that is government red tape.\\n“We help expand the Army’s culture to embrace new approaches and opportunities, applying startup and innovation models to spur new capability development — faster, iterative, open,” Rosanoff said. “About 20 percent of what we’re doing at AAL is finding disruptive technology for the Army. That’s part of it, but fundamentally we’re helping the Army reimagine how it approaches problems.”\\nWASHINGTON — The Pentagon’s new National Defense Strategy lays out a world where great-power competition, rather than counterterrorism, will drive the department’s decision-making and force structure.\\n“Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security,” the 11-page unclassified summary of the strategy reads. Instead, “the central challenge to U.S. prosperity and security is the reemergence of long-term strategic competition,” primarily from China and Russia.\\nThe National Defense Strategy, released Friday, is the second of three interlocking documents that will drive America’s strategic posture. In December, President Donald Trump unveiled his National Security Strategy, which drives the administration’s overall national security posture.\\nThe NDS focuses on the Pentagon’s goals within the NSS and is driven by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. That will be followed later this year by the National Military Strategy, written by Gen. Joe Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which explains how the Pentagon will operationalize the NDS.\\nAt Johns Hopkins University on Friday, Mattis said the document represents a “clear-eyed appraisal” of America’s spot in the world,\\n“This required tough choices — and we made them based upon a fundamental precept: namely, that America can afford survival,” the secretary said in prepared remarks.\\nSpeaking ahead of the document’s release, Elbridge Colby, deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy and force development, said the document was thematically driven by the idea that the “central challenge facing the department of defense and the joint force [is] the erosion of U.S. military advantage vis a vis China and Russia.”\\nBut while great-power competitors are very much front of mind, Colby added that “this is not a strategy of confrontation, but it is a strategy that recognizes the reality of competition and the importance of ‘good fences make good neighbors.’ ”\\nAnd despite the statement in the document, Colby stressed that this does not represent a shift away from fighting terrorism, but rather a realistic acknowledgement that counterterrorism operations are not likely to end anytime soon.\\n“One of the things the strategy is trying to do is say is that we know we are going to be dealing with terrorism in one way or another for the long haul — so let’s figure out ways of doing it that are more cost effective, that are more tailored — that allow us to walk and chew gum at the same time,” he said, adding that there is no assumption of a withdrawal from antiterrorism operations involved in this strategy.\\nOverall, the document bears a clear thumbprint from Mattis, broken down by his stated trio of priorities: strengthening allies and partners, increasing lethality for the war fighter and reforming the business practices of the Pentagon.\\n“The department will do more than just listen to other nations’ ideas — we will be willing to be persuaded by them,” Mattis said. “Not all good ideas come from the country with the most aircraft carriers.”\\nThe document identifies three key theaters of focus — the “Indo-Pacific,” Europe and the Middle East. However, Colby denied that means the U.S. is abandoning areas such as Africa or South America; instead, he described it as realistically focusing resources where they are most needed.\\nHe also said the classified version of the document is about five times the size of the unclassified version, which, if accurate, would put the document at around 50 pages — much thinner than previous strategy products.\\nResource constraints\\nThe strategy release comes the same day Congress is scrambling to avert a government shutdown, with the best case scenario likely to be extending the continuing resolution — which locks in budget numbers at fiscal 2017 levels — into a fifth month. Pentagon officials have consistently harped on what damage occurs with both a shutdown and under a CR.\\nSpeaking ahead of the document release, Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, warned that “a strategy that is set without regard for resource constraint is a strategy that risks being unexecutable” in practice.\\n“If it’s just a lot of words on a page and it doesn’t have numbers, saying ‘this is what it will cost and this is what we’re able to do,’ and ‘this is how we will pay for it,’ it will leave a lot wanting,” he added.\\nThe document released to the public did not include any hard numbers. Asked how much budget realities factored into the strategy, Colby said the document was “not obtuse to resource requirements” but that the focus was on developing the strategy first.\\n“The leadership was actually conscious to say, look, we should have a strategy that is really a strategy that will then drive the budget. But we’re not saying we are going to have an $8 trillion defense budget,” Colby said. “I would say it’s been a realistic look at the environment – of course not just our own funding requirements but also the reality of China as an economy having the same order of magnitude as our own.”\\nThose economic realities extend to allies, with the strategy calling for allies to “pool resources and share responsibility for common defense.” That includes the goal, stated by several DoD officials in recent weeks, of getting equipment to partners more quickly, with the document pledging to “prioritize request for U.S. military equipment sales, accelerating foreign partner modernization and ability to integrate with U.S. forces.”\\nDeveloping technology faster\\nThe strategy contains a section focused on reforming the department’s business structures and getting technology to the warfighter in a more timely fashion.\\n“Success does not go to the country that develops a new technology first, but rather to the one that better integrates it and swiftly adapts its way of fighting,” Mattis said in his remarks.\\nTo do so, the document urges a focus shift from developing a perfect system to getting things into the field and then upgrading them.\\n“The department is over-optimized for exceptional performance at the expense of providing timely decisions, policies and capabilities to the warfighter. Out response will be to prioritize speed of delivery, continuous adaptation and frequent modular updates,” the strategy reads.\\nThe strategy also warns that it is “expected” that the service and agency heads will look to “consolidate, eliminate or restructure” offices as needed to speed up processes. A request for another round of base closure and realignment is also promised, although that remains a tough sell with Congress.\\nAnother notable statement is the pledge of a “major departure from previous practices and culture” in the acquisition realm.\\n“The Department will realign the incentive and reporting structure to increase speed of delivery, enable design tradeoffs in the requirements process, expand the role of warfighters and intelligence analysts throughout the acquisitions process, and utilize non-traditional suppliers,” the document reads. “Prototyping and experimentation should be used prior to defining requirements and commercial off-the-shelf systems. Platform electronics and software must be designed for routine replacement instead of static configurations that last more than a decade.”\\nWASHINGTON — The Pentagon would be required to set up a pilot program for transitioning entire non-tactical vehicle fleets at certain installations to electric power, under legislation advanced by the House.\\nThe bipartisan bill, which the Readiness panel on the House Armed Services Committee approved by voice vote Thursday, would require the secretary of each military department to select an installation for the pilot and submit a plan to make all non-tactical vehicles at that location electric powered by 2025.\\n“The Readiness mark addresses vulnerabilities in installation resiliency and energy resiliency, both in response to climate change and in ensuring that our forces can accomplish their missions even in the event of power disruption, either natural or man-made,” panel chair Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., said ahead of the vote. “We build on previous efforts to address climate change with a particular focus on mitigating the department’s contributions and spurring innovation in clean energy.”\\nThe U.S. Department of Defense is the world’s largest institutional consumer of fossil fuels. It started incorporating climate analysis into its wargaming last year after identifying the risks posed by climate change in its 2018 National Defense Strategy.\\nThe Pentagon released its climate strategy in October. The Army plans to install a microgrid on all its installations by 2035 and field fully electric tactical vehicles by 2050.\\nTo that end, the readiness bill directs each service to prioritize installations that already have charging stations when launching the pilot program.\\nThe full House Armed Services Committee is expected to advance the Readiness bill as part of its annual defense authorization legislation this month.\\nSome Democrats have pushed to codify into law a more ambitious emissions reductions agenda for the Defense Department. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., introduced the Depend on Domestic (DOD) Clean Energy Act last month to set Pentagon targets for reducing emissions while providing greater funding flexibility to achieve those goals.\\nDuckworth told Defense News that she would like to see her legislation included in the Senate version of the defense bill, which the Armed Services Committee is set to mark up next week. Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., introduced identical legislation in the House.\\nThat bill would require the Defense Department make at least 40% of its electricity generation carbon pollution free by 2024 and increase that goal to 100% by 2030. It would also set a target of reducing emissions from Defense Department installations by 20% by 2024 with an ultimate goal of net-zero emissions by 2045.\\nThe measure would also push the Defense Department to continue investing in alternatively fueled vehicles by setting a 100% zero emission target for non-tactical vehicle acquisitions by 2035 and the same goal for tactical vehicles by 2045.\\nPARIS – The air force chiefs representing the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) partner nations took a step toward establishing a synergistic concept of air warfare on June 21, signing a joint document outlining the path ahead as the trinational program moves forward to a new phase.\\nFrench Air and Space Force Chief of Staff Gen. Stéphane Mille, German Air Force Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Ingo Gerhartz and Spanish Air and Space Force Chief of Staff Gen. Javier Salto Martínez-Avial signed a “collaborative air combat” document Wednesday morning in a small ceremony during the biennial Paris Air Show here.\\nFrench Air Force Gen. Jean-Luc Moritz, the service’s FCAS director, described the document as “a common operational vision” highlighting the main requirements and challenges to design a “next-generation warfare system fit for this future collaborative combat.”\\nFrance and Germany first launched the FCAS program in 2017, and Spain joined as an equal partner in 2020. The endeavor aims to deliver a wide gamut of cutting-edge aerospace technologies to the three air forces by roughly 2040.\\nWhile the new air warfare doctrine itself is not yet publicly available, Moritz explained its key tenets.\\nThe warplane thrust of the FCAS program – considered the cornerstone of the future system-of-systems – will henceforth be designated as a “command fighter” aircraft, meaning “a standalone combat capability providing the ability to control unmanned components and to command other combat aircraft, being able to perform C2 [command-and-control] functions,” he said.\\nThe new name denotes how both the “command” and “fighter” elements are equally important, Moritz said. On the command side, the aircraft will employ artificial intelligence (AI) and data link technologies to allow pilots to also perform battlefield management functions while in the air. Meanwhile, the aircraft will also need to act as a traditional fighter to survive future threat environments.\\n“A balanced command fighter is what we need,” Moritz said.\\nWhen it comes to drones accompanying the envisioned aircraft, the collaborative air warfare doctrine will use “swarming and teaming” tactics alongside artificial intelligence to create unpredictability for the adversary, according to Moritz.\\nMeanwhile, the program’s combat cloud pillar will be “the main challenge” of the project, he added. “Mesh, redundant, and heterogeneous networks between any contributors of the Collaborative Air Warfare must avoid any single point of failure,” said Moritz. Key requirements includes the ability to withstand communications jamming, a high level of discretion and dynamic cybersecurity practices.\\nNotably, Belgian Air Chief Maj. Gen. Thierry Dupont was also present at the signing ceremony, although he did not sign the document himself. Belgium has formally joined the FCAS program in an “observer status” for the time being. \\nWASHINGTON — More than 1 million F-35 spare parts worth at least $85 million have gone missing over at least the last five years, according to a new Government Accountability Office report criticizing the program’s supply tracking.\\nAuditors said that because the government doesn’t have its own system tracking those parts, officials may not truly know how many spare parts are actually in the global spares pool, where they are, or their total value.\\nAs a result, “the full quantity and value of these [lost] spare parts may be significantly higher” than the 1 million tally determined by the main contractor, Lockheed Martin, the document reads.\\nAnd disagreements between Defense Department offices and the main F-35 contractor, Lockheed Martin, over how to categorize missing parts are holding up the government’s effort to create its own reliable system to keep track of the parts, the GAO report states.\\nIn short, the F-35 program can’t know whether contractors are properly managing spares, according to auditors, who have tracked losses going to back to 2018.\\nIn a statement to Defense News, Lockheed Martin said the tally of spare parts listed as lost in the report cover the last two decades of the program.\\nLockheed Martin said it is working with the F-35 Joint Program Office and the Defense Contract Management Agency to make sure they have the documentation needed to support disposing of components that staff judged to be “excess, obsolete or unserviceable.”\\n“Lockheed Martin manages F-35 spare part inventory in compliance with contract requirements,” the company told Defense News. “We continue to partner with the Joint Program Office to increase insight into spare part availability and support fleet readiness.”\\nMILAN — The Romanian Defence Ministry has awarded Turkish company Baykar a $321 million contract for TB2 drones, according to recently published documents.\\nThe move comes after the the ministry announced its intention last August to procure three TB2 unmanned aerial system packages from the defense contractor for approximately $300 million, pending approval from Parliament.\\n“The UAS systems to be purchased will be intended for the Romanian Land Forces. Each system includes six aerial platforms with target engagement capabilities (a total of 18 drones). The program also involves the purchase of an initial logistical support package, necessary training and equipment,” the ministry said in a statement at the time.\\nThis week, the Tenders Electronic Daily website, an online version of the Supplement to the Official Journal of the European Union focused on public procurement projects, published the official contract award notice to the Turkish manufacturer for the production of these systems.\\nThe company is to deliver the drones to the Romanian city Timisoara, where the country’s military used to operate the 93rd Air Base that housed MiG-23 fighters before their retirement. Once received, Romania will become the second European Union member after Poland to operate TB2s, and the third European NATO member to order them beyond Turkey.\\nThese acquisitions are to contribute to ambitions laid out as part of the transformation of the Romanian Army until 2040, which seeks to provide forces with new military equipment and weapon systems that ensure flexibility, expanded situational awareness and increased firepower.\\nRomania intends to increase its defense budget to 2.5% of gross domestic product in 2023, Bloomberg reported. Last year, the country allocated roughly $6 billion for defense spending.\\nEarlier this month, a statement issued on the website of Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said the government is also looking to buy F-35 fighter jets to modernize its Air Force.\\nHELSINKI — The Nordic Council has emerged as a driving force to deepen cross-border cyber security collaboration between member states.\\nThe group, which functions as a forum for pan-Nordic cooperation, is positioned to serve as a conduit for discussions between states wanting to explore the development of common cyber defense solutions, and in the long-term a possible joint strategy. Nordic states are moving to elevate cyber-security cooperation against the backdrop of regional tensions over Russia’s war with Ukraine.\\nThe advent of war triggered a steady increase in the number of cyber-attacks against Nordic industry and military targets since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The military targets have included the defense departments of Denmark and Sweden.\\nStrengthening cross-border cyber-security collaboration was one of the significant regional defense issued examined the Nordic Council’s Presidium in December 2022.\\nNorway currently holds the 12-month rotating presidency of the Nordic Council for 2023, having taken over from Finland in December.\\nThe Nordic Defense Cooperation (NORDEFCO) group, which consists of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, will play a key role in the development of cross-border Nordic cyber-security collaborative solitions. The initiative is regarded as a good fit for NORDEFCO’s Vision 2025 project.\\nIn the long term, the military-influenced strategy is to enhance intelligence sharing between countries, giving the Nordic nations a heightened capacity to defend against threats emanating from the cyber domain.\\n“Cybersecurity issues are more relevant than ever. In recent years, the number of serious cyberattacks has grown. Additionally, the war in Ukraine has a direct effect on the Nordic region on many different levels. All these factors serve the need to have a common Nordic cybersecurity strategy,” said Erkki Tuomioja, the Nordic Council’s president for 2022.\\nThe Nordic states have explored the potential for a common cybersecurity strategy since 2016. But Russia’s war in Ukraine and the potential resulting destabilization of the High North and Baltic Sea regions drove a sharper focus on collaboration.\\nNORDEFCO’s Vision 2025 initiative has the scope to be expanded to accommodate a broader new mission for a cybersecurity framework that strengthens Nordic resilience against cyberthreats. NORDEFCO already has the capacity to liaise with military cyberthreat units and national cybersecurity agencies across Nordic nations.\\nIndividually, Nordic states continue to bolster their cyber capacities and make capital investments in new projects. Sweden is investing an additional $130 million in its military budget for 2023-2024 to bolster cyber capabilities. And Finland’s cybersecurity budget during the same period is being doubled to $80 million.\\nFor its part, Iceland launched a national cybersecurity development strategy in 2022 that extends to 2037. The initiative will include joint exercises with Nordic partners to test defensive and offensive cyberthreat solutions.\\n“Cybersecurity isn’t just a security issue. We also need it to fully harness the power of Nordic innovation. We need greater awareness, expertise and regulations covering cybersecurity to enable us to future-proof our society,” said Áslaug Arna Sigurbjörnsdóttir, Iceland’s minister of higher education, science and innovation.\\nEditor’s note: This article was updated on March 13 and March 27, 2023, with new information from the Nordic Council about the steps taken at a December 2022 meeting.\\nWASHINGTON — After two decades of counterinsurgency warfare, the Army is beefing up its investments in artillery, once a core part of America’s ground force. The move is part of the Pentagon’s strategic focus on near-peer adversaries Russia and China.\\nThe Association of the U.S. Army’s annual meeting this week takes place as America’s land force is engaged in a multipronged effort that includes an upgrade to the armored and fully tracked M109A6 Paladin 155mm howitzer and the development of a “strategic long-range cannon” that shoots 1,000 nautical miles (or 1,852 kilometers), Army officials say.\\nThe powerful Senate Armed Senate Armed Services Committee chairman — Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., whose state is home to the Army’s artillery school at Fort Sill — is watching.\\n“I’m concerned that we’re currently behind China and Russia, both in terms of range and rate of fire. During the eight years of [President Barack] Obama, we fell behind. We delayed maintenance and deferred modernization — all while China and Russia were improving their conventional forces and artillery,” Inhofe told Defense News on Oct. 3. “We don’t have the best of everything right now, and I want to make sure we can get the best equipment for our war fighters so they don’t face a situation where they are out-ranged or outgunned.”\\nStill, the Army “is taking the right steps,” Inhofe said, praising Army Secretary Mark Esper’s testimony last month that artillery is a No. 1 priority; a cross-functional team is being dedicated to long-range precision fires — which provides a focus on the Paladin Integrated Management, or PIM, program.\\n“We’re helping, too — Congress delivered adequate, on-time funding for fiscal year 2019, the first time in 10 years, so the Pentagon has the ability to invest in modernization,” Inhofe said. “I’m encouraged by the steps I’ve seen so far, but look forward to frequent, regular updates from the Army on this and all aspects of modernization.”\\nSome of the Army’s artillery modernization efforts have, well, misfires: The $11 billion Crusader self-propelled artillery system was canceled in 2002 largely due to its excessive weight and cost; and the Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon was part of the canceled Future Combat System program.\\nA 2015 study by the think tank Rand praised the Paladin’s digitized fire control system, but said it lags the market. German weaponry has a higher level of automation (for faster firing), other weapons in Paladin’s class out-range it, and closing the range gap requires the more expensive precision-guided round Excalibur.\\nThe Army’s Multiple Launch Rocket System and the similar High Mobility Artillery Rocket System — which is mostly used for counter-fires against enemy artillery — lack the range of some of the heavy, foreign, large-caliber artillery rocket systems, particularly some that have been developed by China, the study found.\\n“Therefore, the rocket systems are falling behind the increasing range of similar Russian and Chinese rocket systems,” the study said. “The trend of foreign, heavy MLRS being able to fire well over 100 km has implications for the U.S. Army’s fires system, including counter fire and target acquisition. Although the Guided MLRS (GMLRS) rocket has exceptional accuracy compared with any fielded foreign system, the suite of munitions available to MLRS and HIMARS is very limited compared with foreign rocket launchers.”\\nHoping to turn the page, the Army has prioritized artillery as part of its modernization reset under the new Army Futures Command. It’s commander, Gen. John Murray, recently told Congress that Army leaders are “looking very hard” at hypersonics and a strategic, long-range cannon, which could have a range of 1,000 nautical miles — among other efforts.\\nIts nascent 499-kilometer Precision Strike Missile, or PrSM, is meant to replace the Tactical Missile System while providing increased standoff range. Congress, however, slowed the program in 2019 appropriations — and the concept butts up against limits in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\\nStill, the Army awarded contracts last year to Raytheon and Lockheed Martin for a three-year period of performance to design and build missile prototypes in the technology-maturation and risk-reduction phase. Army officials said earlier this year they plan to have companies demonstrate prototypes in 2019.\\n“If you want to shoot farther, its armament and its ammunition,” Army Col. John Rafferty, the director of a cross-functional team developing new equipment and concepts for long-range precision fires, told Defense News. “You gotta have a better cannon, better propellant and a better projectile.”\\nThe Army plans to demonstrate projectiles that use ramjet technology, which rely on an internal propellant that ignites in flight, fueling further acceleration. (The Norwegian company Nammo, which hopes to break into the U.S. market, is working with the U.S. Army to provide the relevant base bleed technology and rocket-assist projectiles.)\\nOn Capitol Hill, recently enacted 2019 Pentagon spending appropriations included an added $20 million to pursue Extended Range Cannon Artillery program efforts, and another $67 million to enhance the lethality of an extended-range artillery system — among other plus-ups.\\nOn the testing range, the Army recently doubled a M777 howitzer’s range using a rocket-boosted shell called an XM1113, bringing it a step closer to delivering a prototype long-range cannon capability, according to an Army release.\\nThe Army’s Rapid Capabilities Office had redesigned the M777’s internal chamber to generate more pressure and add a longer 155mm barrel for more muzzle velocity. However, the problem is that a standard round isn’t designed to handle large increases in pressure and muzzle velocity without blowing up mid-flight.\\nThe XM1113 is part of the Insensitive Munition High Explosive Rocket Assisted Projectile program, which takes a 155mm artillery round and extends the cannon range to more than 40 kilometers.\\nAfter years of planning, the PIM program aims to upgrade the Paladin howitzer with an M109A7 chassis. From there, the Extended Range Cannon Artillery program will upgrade PIM’s turret, growing the tube length from 20 to 29 feet, while retaining the 155mm bore diameter.\\n“At the end of it, from the muzzle break all the way to the track pad, you’ve got basically a new self-propelled howitzer,” Rafferty said. “That’s a significant growth in the bore length, and that’s why we’re going to prototype them.”\\nThe Extended Range Cannon Artillery prototyping program will see a mobility study and a formal analysis by Training and Doctrine Command at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. The analysis will look at deployable and tactical mobility, and determine the capability needed, and at what echelons.\\n“We know we need the range; in order to maintain overmatch, we need 70 to 80 kilometers because that’s the start, and then we will be able to get father,” Rafferty said. “Right now we are on a path to 70 kilometers with ERCA, the propellant and the XM113 projectile.”\\nThat effort is due to begin in the next six weeks, with the first prototype due in a year, Rafferty said.\\nWhat’s next? Rafferty said the team will explore auto-loading technology to “roboticize” the ERCA’s internal mechanisms — ostensibly a means to increase the rate of fires.\\n“I think the technology is there to shoot that far,” Rafferty said, “and now it’s how do we optimize the system.”\\nPARIS — Three European nations have teamed up to develop new naval counter-mine capabilities, with France aligning itself with an existing Belgian-Dutch program.\\nDefense officials from the three countries formalized an agreement Oct. 18 during the biennial Euronaval trade conference held outside of Paris, according to the French Armed Forces Ministry. Most significantly, the pact brings two programs together: France’s SLAM-F (système de lutte anti-mines futur), or future anti-mine warfare system, and the Belgian-Dutch Mine Countermeasures (rMCM) system.\\n“France has notably confirmed its decision to launch the design of French mine warfare vessels on the basis of that of the vessels of the binational Belgian-Dutch rMCM program,” the ministry said in a news release. “Thus, the nations share the goals of maximizing design communities to create opportunities for specific joint in-service support and other joint activity related to mine warfare capabilities.”\\nThe SLAM-F effort aims to replace Navy personnel with autonomous vessels for demining missions. It was developed under the Franco-British Maritime Mine Countermeasures Program, launched in 2012 to develop a prototype underwater drone that could detect and neutralize sea mines and underwater improvised explosive devices. The industry team for the prototype program was led by Thales and BAE Systems, with co-partners including the United Kingdom’s branch of Saab, ASV, and Wood and Douglas, as well as France’s ECA Group — which announced Tuesday it will now operate with longtime partner iXBlue under the name Exail.\\nThales delivered the first SLAM-F prototype to the French Navy in 2021. France plans to begin ordering its initial SLAM-F systems in 2023, with a delivery date currently under discussion, the ministry said. Officials previously announced plans to order up to eight unmanned systems.\\nThe Belgian and Dutch navies expect to begin deliveries of their respective rMCM systems in 2024. Naval Group and ECA Group formed a consortium dubbed Belgian Naval and Robotics in 2019 to lead the program. The rMCM program is expected to include 12 minehunter vessels and about 100 unmanned systems split between Belgium and the Netherlands, according to Naval Group.\\nThis past April, Naval Group inaugurated a new mine countermeasures-focused research and development center in Brussels, alongside a lab dedicated to cyber technology.\\nThe French Navy’s top official has called for increased intergovernmental cooperation in the maritime domain to support interoperability and decrease the cost burden on allies. In a speech Monday in Paris ahead of the Euronaval conference, Adm. Pierre Vandier highlighted joint programs and interoperable capabilities as a critical element of France’s future naval force.\\nEditor’s note: This article was updated at 2:50 p.m. June 26 to include comment from the U.S. Army.\\nWASHINGTON — Leonel Garciga, most recently the top technology officer for U.S. Army intelligence, will be the service’s next civilian chief information officer, C4ISRNET and Army Times have learned.\\nGarciga is expected to take the post in mid-July. He will succeed Raj Iyer, who after nearly three years as CIO rejoined private industry, according to an internal announcement. The position has been vacant for months now.\\nAn Army spokesperson on June 26 said Garciga “will spearhead the Army’s technological transformation efforts, ensuring the effective management and utilization of information systems across the organization.”\\n“Having led the Army Intelligence Community CIO for four years, Garciga has extensive experience in developing innovative solutions and driving digital advancements” that will “play a pivotal role in enhancing the Army’s capabilities in an increasingly complex and rapidly evolving digital landscape,” the spokesperson said in a statement.\\nGarciga did not immediately respond to a message on social media seeking comment.\\nGarciga currently serves as the director for information management within the Army’s G-2 intelligence directorate, where he oversees the service’s implementation of revamped intelligence community information and data practices. He has held that position since early 2019.\\nHis next gig will be a step up: As CIO, Garciga will oversee an information technology portfolio totaling billions of dollars, including hundreds of millions for cloud computing and adoption in fiscal 2023.\\nThe Army, the military’s largest service, is pushing what it calls “digital transformation” — the phasing in of new technologies, connectivity and online techniques. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth has said achieving force-wide digital fluency is her No. 2 objective.\\nBefore taking the tech reins in the G-2, Garciga spent more than seven years at the Defense Department’s improvised explosive device research arm. Garciga was also an enlisted Navy submariner and a graduate of the Naval Nuclear Power School.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Army took two shots from its Extended Range Cannon Artillery system, which both reached 65 kilometers in range and hit their intended targets, in a demonstration at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, on March 6, according to Brig. Gen. John Rafferty, who is in charge of long-range precision fires modernization, the Army’s top priority.\\nThe demonstration proves the cannon is capable of firing roughly 40 miles, which is about the distance between Washington, D.C., and Annapolis, Maryland. The capability would also benefit the service should it face near-peer adversaries on the battlefield.\\nIt is unclear whether the Army was pushing its shots out to the maximum range of capability or if the projectiles are capable of reaching farther ranges.\\nA long-range cannon is intended to give the service a desired level of standoff outside of the range of enemy artillery, where it can destroy those threats and open up windows of opportunity to advance on the enemy in highly contested environments.\\nThe Army’s Long-Range Precision Fires Cross-Functional Team under Army Futures Command has made the ERCA system development one of its centerpiece priorities over the past several years.\\nIn 2018, the service was able to double the range of cannon artillery using a modified M777 howitzer by adding a supercharged propellant and the XM1113 rocket-assisted projectile, which takes a 155mm artillery round and extends the cannon range to more than 60 kilometers by providing rocket-assist capability.\\nIn the demonstration at Yuma, the Army fired — from a 58-caliber, 30-foot gun tube — a Raytheon-made Excalibur extended-range guided artillery shell and an XM1113 using supercharged propellant.\\nThe ERCA system in the demonstration — called the XM1299 prototype zero — was integrated by BAE Systems, the manufacturer of the M109A7 Paladin Integrated Management (PIM) howitzer.\\nBAE Systems received an Army contract less than a year ago in July 2019 to integrate the Army-developed cannon onto the PIM howitzer chassis, and the company will make the first 18 prototypes..\\nThe Army will hold an industry day for ERCA’s second increment in the next three to four months once the acquisition strategy is approved by Army leadership, Rafferty said during a media roundtable following the demonstration. After the industry day, the Army will be able to discuss more publicly its business relationship going into the second prototyping phase, he added.\\nThe near-term objective on the program is to deliver approximately six batteries of the towed howitzer capabilities to be used in the field. The Army plans to begin fielding the ERCA cannon in fiscal 2023.\\nThe ERCA cannon is a step ahead of a bigger program to develop a strategic, long-range cannon that could shoot 1,000 nautical miles, or 1,852 kilometers.\\nSTUTTGART, Germany — NATO is set to establish a new trans-Atlantic initiative meant to speed up the development of critical technologies, with one Euro-centric headquarters stationed in London and more than 60 partner sites around its alliance.\\nLast summer at the 31st annual NATO Summit in Brussels, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced plans to establish the Defence Innovation Accelerator of the North Atlantic, or DIANA, based on the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\\nNearly a year later, NATO’s foreign ministers are ready to approve a formal charter for DIANA and commit to providing an initial €1 billion (U.S. $1.1 billion) innovation fund. The ministers will approve DIANA’s charter during their April 6-7 meeting in Brussels, Stoltenberg said April 5 during a pre-ministerial press briefing.\\nThe initiative comes with more than 60 innovation sites. That includes a headquarters in Europe and another in North America, about 10 “accelerator sites” that provide financing, mentorship and exposure to business opportunities to participating startups, and more than 50 dedicated test centers hosting labs and equipment.\\n“Altogether, the initial footprint will cover 20 NATO nations, representing a true trans-Atlantic endeavor, and we expect it will continue to expand in the future,” Stoltenberg said.\\nThe technology accelerator will be a new NATO body, tasked to bring innovative civilian and military organizations closer together to develop cutting-edge solutions in the realms of emerging and disruptive technologies, said David van Weel, NATO assistant secretary general for emerging security challenges.\\nThe plan is for allies to agree upon a new strategic direction every two years, which will then dictate critical defense and security problems as well as the desired solutions.\\n“This provides strong signals of market demand and opportunity for innovators,” van Weel said at a Tuesday press briefing.\\nFrom there, startups, academic institutions and nontraditional industry members can participate in so-called challenge programs that work to solve real-world problems — such as operating in a GPS-denied environment — and submit proposals to participate in DIANA’s accelerator effort.\\nMember nations submitted proposals for more than 90 institutions to be part of the DIANA footprint; after evaluations, NATO pared it down to more than 10 accelerator sites and over 50 test centers, with many already in existence, van Weel said.\\nAmong those selected sites are the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, which will focus on quantum technologies, and a new site in Turin, Italy, which will be dedicated to the space domain.\\nImperial College London will host the European headquarters along with a DIANA accelerator, in a space currently housing the U.K.’s Defence and Security Accelerator, according to the British government. The U.K.’s program will be “twinned” with a new accelerator based in Tallinn, Estonia, to help share expertise, test cyber innovations and explore the viability of “virtual sites” to trial new tech such as autonomous vehicles.\\n“The UK and Estonia are two of the most innovative countries in NATO, and our hosting of DIANA will harness that innovation for the benefit of all allies tackling future military threats,” British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said in a news release.\\nWhile the centers on the European side have all been selected, the North American footprint will be announced at the NATO Summit in June in Madrid, Spain. The goal is to have DIANA reach its full operational capability by 2025, said van Weel.\\nAlongside the tech accelerator is a nascent venture capital fund, dubbed the NATO Innovation Fund. “Ultimately, reimagining NATO’s engagement with civilian innovators is only credible if we also provide the right funding mechanisms,” van Weel noted.\\nTwenty-one members worked together to establish the underlying framework of the fund — outlining the investment strategy, the pool of capital, and determining the fund’s structure and governance. They also provided initial financial support. The Innovation Fund will invest €1 billion into “deep-tech startups” over 15 years. These are public funds that participating nations can allocate, either from their existing defense budgets or established innovation funds, a senior NATO official said Tuesday.\\nThe participating nations in DIANA’s innovation fund currently include Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Turkey and the United Kingdom.\\nOther member nations can decide to contribute to the Innovation Fund at a later date, but they would have no say over its framework, the NATO official said.\\nA key aspect of DIANA will be to support NATO’s work in harnessing critical technology areas known as emerging and disruptive technologies, or EDT. The alliance recently identified propulsion and new materials as two new EDTs the deserve attention, joining artificial intelligence, autonomy, big-data processing, quantum-enabled technologies, biotechnology, hypersonic technology and space-related systems.\\nNATO has released public strategies for several of these EDTs — for space, AI and big-data processing. The alliance’s strategy on autonomy is expected to be released this year, and one on quantum-enabled technologies will come the following year, the official said.\\nWASHINGTON — The proposed budget bill that would fund the U.S. government for the rest of fiscal 2022 provides funding for 20 more C-130J Super Hercules aircraft for the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard.\\nSixteen of the added C-130Js would go to the Air National Guard to modernize two operational wings at an additional cost of $1.8 billion, according to a summary of the omnibus spending bill released by congressional appropriators Wednesday. The remaining four, which would add $429 million to the spending bill, would go to the Reserve.\\nThe increased spending for new C-130Js — now totaling nearly $2.4 billion, up from almost $129 million in the administration’s budget request — would be a boon to Lockheed Martin, which makes the mobility aircraft.\\nIt also represents the bulk of the increase to the Air Force’s aircraft procurement spending lawmakers added to the administration’s FY22 budget request. The original request called for $15.7 billion in aircraft procurement spending, but the omnibus bill would spend $18.4 billion.\\nThe Air National Guard is now in the midst of a multiyear effort to upgrade its mobility fleet and replace its three-decade-old C-130H Hercules planes with modern C-130Js.\\nC-130Js have improved engines with six-blade propellers that provide more thrust and efficiency than their predecessor’s four-blade propeller engines, allowing it to fly farther and faster. They also have digital avionics, upgraded displays, improved navigation and radar systems, more cargo space, a digital autopilot, and the need for a smaller aircrew.\\nIn November 2020, the Air Force announced it had selected Air National Guard bases in Kentucky, West Virginia, Texas and Georgia to receive 24 C-130Js to replace their aging “H” models. At the time, Democrats objected to the Air Force’s surprise decision to select a fourth base — Savannah Air National Guard Base in Georgia — shortly before the runoff elections for both Senate seats there.\\nThe Air National Guard’s director, Lt. Gen. Mike Loh, said in a roundtable with reporters last year that modernizing the force’s mobility fleet, including upgrading older C-130Hs, is crucial.\\n“In order to keep old aircraft around, it’s costing me a lot of money,” Loh said at the Air Force Association’s Air, Space and Cyber conference in Maryland in September 2021.\\nThe budget deal also would considerably increase spending on C-130 modifications, from the administration’s original $29 million request to $272 million.\\nThis would include another $151 million for upgrading older C-130s with eight-blade propellers, and another added $79 million for engine enhancements.\\nThese eight-blade composite propellers were designed to make C-130Hs more efficient as well as to provide more thrust during takeoff and while climbing.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Air Force’s secretive Next Generation Air Dominance future fighter program could be the most expensive aircraft program in history, with each piloted, sixth-generation aircraft expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\\nWhen asked about the price tag for NGAD during a Wednesday appearance before the House Armed Services Committee, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall did not specify exactly how much an individual aircraft could cost, but said the service was talking about “multiple” hundreds of millions.\\n“This is a number that’s going to get your attention,” Kendall said. “It’s going to be an expensive airplane.”\\nWASHINGTON — With Sweden and Finland poised to join NATO, countries in the region are debating ways of more effectively defending the alliance’s northern flank, putting new divisions of labor on the table for connecting forces from the Baltic Sea to the North Sea.\\nThe discussions are expected to culminate in a revamped military exercise in 2024, for which planning has already begun. The Norway-hosted drill, dubbed Cold Response, is a recurring exercise involving cold-weather operations. It is slated to see elevated Finnish and Swedish roles along with a name change to Nordic Response, a Norwegian defense official accompanying Defence Minister Bjørn Arild Gram to Washington told reporters earlier this month.\\nCentral to the new thinking is a desire to view the territories of Norway, Sweden and Finland — and to some extent the other two countries considered part of the Nordic region, Denmark and Iceland — more holistically in defense plans.\\nWhile such thinking has been in the works for a while, prospective membership of all five Nordic nations in NATO has spurred new ideas.\\n“We already have a good cooperation on [a] broad basis, also on defense, but still: All in the same alliance will be something different,” Gram told reporters Sept. 21 following a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.\\nThere is still an awareness of different regional priorities across the contiguous land mass forming the Scandinavian Peninsula, Gram said. So casting Finland as the leader on land forces, owing to its long border with Russia, while having Norway focus on naval capabilities would be too simplistic of a view, he added.\\nBut a cross-cutting view of the geography could highlight second-order effects previously not seen, he argued. “What happens in one area can affect the other,” he noted, citing as examples Sweden’s and Finland’s Baltic Sea orientation as well as Norway’s long western exposure to the North Atlantic’s waters.\\nSuch an event entered global attention this week, days after Gram’s trip to Washington, as several sections of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines through the Baltic Sea sprung leaks from what NATO has labeled sabotage. Analysts now wonder if oil and gas infrastructure in the North Sea could be targets next.\\nThe government in Oslo announced on Sept. 30 that the military would increase its readiness around critical energy installations in Norway’s water. “Norwegian Armed Forces are present and conducting patrols with assets on land, in the air, at sea, under water and in cyberspace,” reads a statement.\\n“The Royal Norwegian Air Force is conducting frequent patrols with F-35 fighter jets, both from Ørland Air Base and the Quick Reaction Alert out of Evenes Air Base,” the statement adds, noting that giving too much detail about defensive measures would compromise sensitive information. On Friday, aircraft were patrolling Norwegian territory, including the oil and gas facilities at the Draugen and Heidrun Oilu fields west of the country, the Norwegian Armed Forces said.\\nAs countries in the region examine their infrastructure networks and military-basing layouts, linking air operations more closely may be one of the lower-hanging fruits. “It’s a very good example because we see that we can integrate and share infrastructure, share a common air picture and so on, Gram said. “We can cover each other, cover the whole area.”\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Air Force has awarded Boeing a contract worth up to $1.2 billion to start work on the first E-7A battle management and command-and-control aircraft, with plans to field a fleet of 26 in total, the service said Tuesday.\\nThe E-7, which the service hopes to first field in fiscal 2027, is a modernized battlefield management aircraft originally developed for the Royal Australian Air Force and dubbed the Wedgetail. The United Kingdom, South Korea and Turkey also either fly the E-7 or plan to buy it.\\nThe U.S. Air Force said the E-7 will provide advanced airborne moving target indication, battle management and command-and-control capabilities. It will also carry an advanced multirole, electronically scanned array radar for better airborne battle management, which will allow the U.S. and its allies to carry out long-range strikes against advanced enemies, the service said.\\n“The E-7A will be the [Department of the Air Force’s] principal airborne sensor for detecting, identifying, tracking and reporting all airborne activity to joint force commanders,” Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter said in the service’s statement. The Wedgetail “will enable greater airborne battlespace awareness through its precise, real-time air picture and will be able to control and direct individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.”\\nThe Air Force decided last year to buy the E-7 to replace the aging E-3 Sentry, an airborne warning and control system aircraft. The AWACS dates back to the 1970s, and the Air Force plans to retire 13 of them — roughly half the fleet — this year, and eventually phase the rest out as E-7s come online.\\n“We conducted a thorough analysis of viable industry options to ensure the selected E-3 replacement could meet the specific needs of the U.S.,” Hunter said. “Until the E-7A is fielded, we will continue to rely on the E-3 AWACS.”\\nThe contract award paves the way for production on the first rapid prototype E-7 to begin in FY25, and for the Air Force to field it two years later. The service said it plans to procure 24 more E-7 aircraft by FY32, on its way to acquiring a total fleet of 26.\\nWhen the Air Force originally announced in April 2022 it had selected the E-7, it said it also planned to award funding for a second rapid prototype aircraft in FY24, and would make a production decision on the rest of the fleet the following year.\\n“The rapid prototyping program will integrate U.S.-based mission systems into the existing airborne platform to meet [Department of the Air Force] requirements while simultaneously ensuring interoperability with coalition and allied partners already operating the E-7A,” Hunter said.\\nLawmakers such as Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., expressed concern in 2022 about the Air Force’s plan to retire half its AWACS fleet before the first E-7 arrives, and they were worried it could leave the service with a capability gap.\\nHunter told reporters at the July 2022 Royal International Air Tattoo in England that the Air Force didn’t have many options for quickening the process of acquiring E-7s, which are based on Boeing’s 737 airframe. There aren’t many suitable used 737 airframes the government could acquire to convert into E-7s, Hunter said, because the battle management aircraft has a “unique combination” of components.\\nWASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin’s decision to publicly back a new next-generation engine for the F-35 — breaking with the Pentagon’s move to upgrade the fighter’s current Pratt & Whitney-made engines — drew a forceful rebuke from Pratt.\\nGreg Ulmer, executive vice president for aeronautics, said in a Wednesday interview with Breaking Defense at the Paris Air Show that the company supports the Adaptive Engine Transition Program for the F-35 fighter jet.\\n“I’m going to advocate, and I do advocate, for [AETP], another engine,” Ulmer told Breaking Defense. “I think some of the approaches today are very short sighted and not considering a longer-term view.”\\nIn an email to Defense News, Lockheed Martin said an AETP engine would provide greater power and cooling capabilities that would carry the F-35 beyond upcoming Block 4 upgrades. Block 4 is expected to give the F-35 new sensors, the ability to carry more weapons and advanced electronic warfare capabilities, among other upgrades.\\n“We stand ready to support and continue to work with the U.S. government on the capability and performance upgrades that best support their requirements for the F-35 for decades to come — including an engine upgrade,” Lockheed Martin said. “AETP technologies deliver more power and greater cooling capability, which is required as we modernize the F-35 beyond Block 4.”\\nIn a statement to Defense News, Pratt & Whitney said Ulmer’s statement “undermines” the Pentagon’s budgetary decision to back the Engine Core Upgrade, the company’s name for its plan to modernize the fighter’s current F135 engines.\\n“AETP is a technology that will feed into [sixth-generation] fighter platforms,” Jill Albertelli, Pratt & Whitney’s president of military engines, said in a statement. “Lockheed Martin wants to put an unproven adaptive engine on a single engine fighter jet, regardless of the hefty price tag and the significant delay in delivering critical capabilities to the warfighter at a time of urgent need.”\\nAlbertelli noted the Pentagon has not yet defined a set of capabilities that the next set of upgrades beyond Block 4 should carry. And she said Pratt’s planned upgrade of the F135 engine, coupled with an updated power thermal management system, could provide enough power and cooling needs for the F-35 throughout the life of the program.\\nThe F-35 is expected to fly until 2070, Lockheed said, which means further upgrades are required for the decades to come in order to stay ahead of emerging threats. An upgraded engine will be needed to provide the aircraft with greater capabilities, readiness, range and thrust, the F-35 manufacturer added.\\nLockheed also noted that both General Electric Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney are developing their own AETP engines. GE’s adaptive engine is called the XA100 and Pratt’s is the XA101.\\nBut while GE has consistently pushed for putting its adaptive engine in the F-35, Pratt maintains an adaptive engine is better suited for a sixth-generation aircraft such as the Next Generation Air Dominance platform currently under development by the U.S. Air Force.\\nThe Air Force was intrigued by the increased power and cooling abilities an adaptive engine would bring to its F-35As over an upgrade to the existing F135 engine. But the adaptive engine’s inability to fit in an F-35B variant, flown by the Marine Corps, and questions over how suitable it would be for the Navy’s F-35C version meant the Air Force was the only service seriously interested in an adaptive engine.\\nThe Pentagon decided the cost of funding both engine options would be too great and announced a decision to go with the Engine Core Upgrade in the fiscal 2024 budget proposal. The department did not request funding for AETP.\\nBut the House Armed Services Committee this month proposed a version of the FY24 National Defense Authorization Act that would add more than $588 million for AETP, alongside funding the Engine Core Upgrade.\\nWASHINGTON — Northrop Grumman expects the Air Force to award the first production contract for the B-21 Raider stealth bombers later this year.\\nIn an earnings call with analysts Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Dave Keffer said the expected contract will be for the first of five low-rate initial production lots. The LRIP phase is scheduled to run through roughly the end of the decade, he said.\\nBut Keffer said Northrop Grumman and the Air Force are wary of macroeconomic risks — particularly inflation, labor problems and lingering supply chain issues — and are looking for ways to make the program more efficient and manage those concerns as it moves out of the engineering and manufacturing development phase.\\nNorthrop Grumman chief executive Kathy Warden said Wednesday the B-21 is still on track for its first flight later this year, following its “historic” rollout in December.\\nWarden said “unprecedented” inflation, supply chain disruptions and labor issues have raised the bomber’s cost estimates on its LRIP phase. But cost projections are still coming in below the government’s estimates, she said, and the government continues to support buying at least 100 of the advanced stealth bombers.\\nNorthrop Grumman said in its financial filings it doesn’t see a financial loss on any of these LRIP options as “probable” — but couldn’t rule out a loss of up to $1.2 billion on one or more lots as “reasonably possible.”\\nWarden said a potential loss would spread out over all five lots, which would help Northrop absorb the blow.\\n“Inflation clearly is the primary driver there, as we think about what’s changed recently in our estimates, and we are working to mitigate those impacts,” Warden said. “We have some time as we move forward and get into production to continue to do that.”\\nShe said the government is talking with defense firms like Northrop about ways to encourage them to invest in future capabilities, while helping industry weather the risks that come with inflation.\\nThat could lead to less reliance on fixed-price development contracts in the future, she said. The defense industry is now “pushing back” on long-term fixed-price contracts, she said, and asking for the government to reconsider some contracts to take inflation into account.\\nMany government customers “now understand that shifting too much risk to industry doesn’t support that investment, nor does it deliver the capability they need in a timely fashion,” Warden said. “I expect we’re going to see less fixed-price development going forward.”\\nSuppliers to Northrop Grumman are also asking the company to take into account how inflation has increased their costs, Warden said. Northrop in turn passes those costs on to the government.\\n“Really that’s just common sense,” Warden said. “I believe that will become the norm.”\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Army is turning to small business innovators to figure out a way to increase the rate of fire of self-propelled howitzers, according to an Aug. 25 service statement.\\nThe effort is through an Army Small Business Innovation Research pilot that brings government and industry best practices to help drive innovative solutions, according to the release.\\n“This rate of fire aspect is more than just putting rounds in the back of the howitzers,” Brig. Gen. John Rafferty, who is in charge of the Army’s Long Range Precision Fires modernization efforts, said in the statement. “It’s also about asking, ‘where do we spend all of our time?’ We spend a lot of our time handling unpacking, unloading and downloading ammunition. If we can do that more efficiently we will become a more combat effective unit,” he said.\\nThe program breaks down “long-standing barriers small businesses have face in working with the Army: transparency, access and capital,” the statement added.\\nThe goal is to put small businesses on contract within a month of the close of the submission period, according to the statement.\\nCompanies could receive up to $200,000 during the first phase of the effort, which is expected to last four months “with considerable increases for Phase II and beyond,” the statement read.\\nAnd these companies involved “also have the option to participate in a cohort program that grants them unparalleled access to the soldiers who will use their technologies and to Army problem owners,” the statement explained. “By working with these stakeholder groups, innovators can have confidence that the solution they design effectively matches Army needs.”\\nEarlier this year the Army’s Field Artillery Autonomous Resupply cohort run by the Army Applications Lab marked the first time the service gave companies a chance to “explore the problem and immerse themselves into the problem,” Rafferty said. “It has proven to be an effective process.”\\nThe FAAR participants received $150,000 to complete a 12-week program ending in a pitch to the Army. The Army picked six companies to work on ways to improve the currently cumbersome, taxing and sometimes risky munitions resupply system for field artillery units operating M109 Paladin howitzers.\\nThe Army is also working on an autoloader for the service’s future Extended-Range Cannon Artillery program and plans to field it by 2024. The service toyed with the idea of tapping non-traditional business to come up with a new autoloader but decided instead to go with a government-developed technology demonstrator, which has undergone testing at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona.\\nThe Army shifted the cohort’s focus to improve the entire system that resupplies munitions to the guns.\\nEfforts included contributions to an entire resupply system from ordering, to a tracking system, to a transport method and even how ammunition is packaged in order to make resupply faster and more efficient.\\nThe cohort was expected to wrap up capability presentations in April.\\nThe Army is accepting applications for the effort it is calling “Fire Faster” between Sept. 18 and Oct. 6.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Air Force on Friday conducted the first test flight of an F-35 loaded with a series of upgrades known as Technology Refresh 3.\\nThe successful test flight marks a step toward loading the fighter with improved computer memory and processing power, and it lays the groundwork for a major modernization effort known as Block 4.\\nThe 461st Flight Test Squadron conducted the 50-minute test flight of the F-35A, which had the tail number AF-7, at Edwards Air Force Base in California, the F-35 Joint Program Office said Tuesday.\\nExperimental test pilot Maj. Ryan “Bolo” Luersen flew the jet to an altitude of 35,000 feet and at nearly Mach speed as he verified its airworthiness and system stability.\\nTechnology Refresh 3 includes software and hardware upgrades for the Lockheed Martin-made F-35 to improve its displays, memory and computer processing power, which will allow the fighter to store and process more data as well as run advanced software.\\nWASHINGTON — The Defense Department will stop accepting some newly built F-35 Joint Strike Fighters beginning next month as delays in upgrading the fighter drag on.\\nThe planned delivery halt of new fighters loaded with Technology Refresh 3 hardware means manufacturer Lockheed Martin may have to store dozens of the planes at its main factory in Fort Worth, Texas, for much of the rest of the year, and perhaps into spring 2024.\\nSTUTTGART, Germany — NATO member nations agreed in 2022 to create the Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, or DIANA, as a means to connect the alliance to startups and academic institutions working on emerging and disruptive technologies relevant to defense.\\nThrough regularly occurring “technology challenges” and partnerships with more than 75 associated tech clearinghouses and test centers based in Europe and in North America, DIANA’s leaders hope to find promising solutions to real-world problems, such as operating in GPS-denied environments.\\nThe organization’s first managing director, Deeph Chana, started work in May after formerly serving as director of the Imperial College London’s Institute for Security Science and Technology and co-director of the school’s Centre for Financial Technology.\\nChana spoke with Defense News about what he hopes to bring to the table for DIANA and what to expect for its initial endeavors. This interview was edited for length and clarity.\\nWhat aspects of DIANA are the most promising to realize NATO’s 2030 science and technology goals? What are the most challenging aspects?\\nBuilding DIANA is a major step toward fulfilling the NATO 2030 goals. We are creating an innovation engine to keep NATO at the forefront of technology. DIANA will work with the best talent from across the alliance to help develop dual-use technologies to solve strategic security and defense challenges.\\nDIANA will also work closely with the NATO Innovation Fund, a separate body which will invest €1 billion (U.S. $1.1 billion) in early-stage startups investing in emerging and disruptive technologies.\\nI talk a lot about us wanting to convene the triple helix of industry, government and academia; DIANA will enable us to do this. Our wider mission is to enhance resilience and build security in society, which includes addressing global systemic risks, such as climate change.\\nThe unique aspect here, therefore, is recognizing the need for a more complete defense mission — developing and implementing disruptive technologies to mitigate the likelihood and impacts of conflict.\\nWhat do you hope to bring from your previous careers and experience to the role of managing director for DIANA? What are some specific achievements or projects you’ve worked on that will directly inform this job?\\nI am a physicist by training and have spent most of my career working with deep science and technology, not just on the theoretical side but also on real-world solutions. Early in my career, for example, I worked on the Blu-ray project with Philips, so I understand how to get from fundamental scientific concepts to products.\\nA good part of my career has also been in the U.K. government where, among other things, I ran a unit responsible for funding science and technology to mitigate national and international security threats.\\nSo I have a deep understanding of the risks that we face in society and how science, technology and innovation are crucial to addressing them.\\nIn the latter part of my career, I have worked in startups and academia, building and working with early-stage technology companies for over a decade, and focusing on innovation.\\nBeing a professor at Imperial College, I have spent considerable time and effort exploring and developing models for innovation ecosystems that enable the sustained growth of technology startups. I’m looking forward to focusing this breadth of experience on the task of standing up DIANA and setting it up for success.\\nWhat are your goals for your first year as managing director? What initiatives and planned milestones have you set for DIANA as an organization?\\nWe are making good progress in standing up DIANA, and a big milestone is reaching initial operating capability, which will happen ahead of the NATO Summit in Vilnius in July.\\nWe are looking to support world-class innovators as they develop cutting-edge, dual-use technologies. And very soon, DIANA will be launching its pilot challenge programs for 2023. Soon after that, we will be welcoming our first cohort of startups to the accelerator program; that’s a really big milestone.\\nDIANA is absolutely committed to work with the best out there — innovators with great ideas that can develop them in an agile manner, enabled by us, and attract further investment in the future.\\nIn parallel, we recently opened our first regional office in the U.K. in London. Our regional office in North America will be in Halifax, Canada, and DIANA will also have a regional hub in Tallinn, Estonia. We will leverage a network of more than 100 accelerator sites and test centers in innovation clusters across Europe and North America, and we hope that this network will continue to grow and establish itself over the coming years.\\nA key priority for me as managing director is to create an organization that is agile and to build a culture that attracts top talent. I want DIANA to be diverse and inclusive, as I believe that our defense, security and technology institutions need to better represent society and its makeup. Getting the organizational culture right will be critical to the long-term success of DIANA.\\nWhat is the status of the technology challenges for DIANA? Which technology areas or needs will they focus on, and how can interested entities get involved?\\nWe are launching our pilot challenges in June, with three themes for the 2023 program: energy resilience; secure information sharing; and sensing and surveillance. You can find out more on DIANA’s website, and we have a portal there now for registering interest. The website is also where the full details of the challenges will be published and where innovators will be able to apply when the calls go live.\\nDIANA is looking for people who are technically exceptional and those who can connect their technology to our dual-use mission — innovators who can see their technology applied to a civilian problem over here and a more tactical military problem over there.\\nTo be blunt, we want less of the old-school thinking about defense. I’m not going to be too keen on us encouraging people who think that the way things are working now is fine and that DIANA is just an accelerator to make the current system run faster. That is very clearly not what DIANA is about. We are about disrupting the vision of defense and enabling emerging and disruptive technologies to be brought to bear, efficiently, to this reimagined view.\\nWhat is the 2023 budget for DIANA, and how is it split up between operations, funding for challenges and so on?\\nI won’t go into the specifics of our funding right now, as this will be published at the right time on our website, but DIANA is well resourced, with a budget of tens of millions of euros. I’m very conscious of the fact that the grants and support that DIANA will give will be at levels that can enable innovators in a meaningful way to realize their ideas. I’m really looking forward to working with them to make that happen. We have done our market analysis, and we know what it takes to support a startup properly and competitively.\\nIt is important to understand that the financial burn rate for companies varies greatly, depending on what technology is being developed. Hardware development is typically a more cost-intensive endeavor than purely software-based systems.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Air Force is experimenting with a mix of drones, artificial intelligence and cloud collaboration to find ways to slash the time it takes to inspect aircraft for wear and tear.\\nIn trials backed by aircraft manufacturer Boeing and Near Earth Autonomy, a developer of drone operating systems, service technicians at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii are launching autonomous uncrewed aerial systems with mounted cameras to catalog the condition of Boeing C-17 cargo planes that transport heavy weapons and passengers.\\nThe goal is to reduce the complexity of aircraft checkups while also improving the accuracy and reliability of information. Whereas traditional exterior examinations can take hours and still miss tiny details, the drone-centric approach, fueled by pattern recognition and 3D models, is far quicker and feeds verified observations to a secure repository, officials said.\\n“A preflight inspection right now can take up to four hours. We can do it in 30 minutes. That is a significant time savings for airmen and making sure that the aircraft is available, ready to go,” Alli Locher, a manager with Near Earth Autonomy, told reporters June 27 at an event in Virginia. “Eventually you’ll be able to just pull up a tail number, click anywhere on that 3D model of that aircraft and be able to see a history of images of that exact part you clicked on, from anywhere in the world over the life of the aircraft.”\\nAs the U.S. Defense Department prepares for potential fights in the Indo-Pacific region and Europe, the Air Force is pursuing a concept known as Agile Combat Employment. ACE envisions a hub-and-spoke layout of bases: some larger and fixed, some smaller and mobile.\\nSuch an approach will spread out human effort and know-how — resources already in high demand — so having a reliable, centralized means of collecting and evaluating the status of an aircraft will be all the more important, according to Scott Belanger, a Boeing Global Services executive. Boeing is the third-largest defense contractor in the world when ranked by defense revenue.\\n“The pictures are, literally, instantaneously live, sent to a cloud environment, where they can be analyzed by Near Earth Autonomy software and our automated damage detection software,” he said. “We’re not trying to replace the human inspection. We’re trying to inform it. We’re trying to upskill that human inspection so when they do go on the tail, they’re not guessing: They know exactly what to bring, they know exactly what to expect.”\\nIn testing, the drones and associated routines have detected “up to 76%, 78% damage,” according to Belanger. While that’s a “high C,” he said, it beats out the human-only metric of 50%.\\nMoving forward, Boeing and Near Earth Autonomy are eyeing more payloads for the drones, to potentially catch subsurface damage, as well as adding more aircraft to the inspection roster. Lockheed Martin’s C-5 plane was most recently programmed, according to Locher. Boeing’s KC-135 and KC-46 could be next.\\n“Our secret sauce here, that we use, is we have an autonomy back end on this drone that always knows where it is relative to the aircraft, not the environment around it,” Locher said. “With that, you can pretty much run any sensor and get a map of that sensor.”\\nUPDATE — This story has been updated to reflect the current acquisition path as of July 2020.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Army still plans to release of its request for proposals in December to replace the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, and it wants industry to prioritize an open architecture in its designs.\\n“The network is almost more important in some ways than building the combat vehicles,” Maj. Gen. Brian Cummings, program executive officer of ground combat systems, told Defense News in an interview ahead of the Association of the U.S. Army’s virtual conference.\\nThe future optionally manned fighting vehicle will need the flexibility to be networked with other capabilities across the battlefield, and designed such that capabilities can plug into the vehicle at the forward edge. This realization was highlighted during the Army’s Project Convergence exercise at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, which wrapped up last month and during which an OMFV surrogate played a part.\\nThe Army will focus on the effort to develop OMFV with an open architecture and, “to be blunt, a lot of things ... that we originally asked for, we may actually look to take out because it’s not as powerful as the ability to get that inside what we want in the next combat vehicle,” Cummings said.\\nThe Army released a draft RFP in July and backed off one plan in that proposal to submit its own bid, which was met with scrutiny as industry officials questioned whether the service could play the game after Army leaders had already seen industry’s cards during an earlier iteration of the competition. The move, many in industry thought, would have easily teed up protests.\\nThis is the second attempt to hold a competition for OMFV after the service’s first try ended up with just one bid because the Army’s requirements proved too onerous to industry and included a requirement to deliver a working prototype to the Army by October 2019.\\nThe Army canceled that solicitation in January and issued a new market survey in February that asked industry to weigh in on what affected their decisions to participate, or not, in the previous OMFV competitive effort and how the Army might better engage with industry this time.\\nInstead of a laundry list of requirements that, when paired together, became unachievable in the timeline, the Army laid out nine characteristics to help shape designs.\\nThe Army plans to request whitepapers and then choose five prime contractor teams to design rough digital prototypes. The service will then award up to three contracts for a detailed design and prototype phase that will include options for low-rate initial production. One vendor will be selected to go into production.\\nIn response to the draft RFP, the Army got “hundreds of comments from industry,” Brig. Gen. Ross Coffman, who is in charge of next-generation combat vehicle development, said in the same Oct. 8 interview. “Industry, writ large, is communicating with us. We are listening and we’re able to take that. It’s helping us inform the final RFP.”\\nCummings said the hope of sticking with digital designs for the first few phases of the competition opens up more opportunity for innovation “so we’re not locked in right from the beginning that the government has this grand design of what we want to have built in the end.”\\nBut that also means there’s a constant battle of maintaining clarity over what the Army needs in the design and leaving room for creativity.\\nThe Army is now working through what must be set in stone now, according to Cummings, and whether that is crew size or other possible requirements. “Maybe we don’t want to have them fixated within that yet,” he said.\\nWith the draft RFP, it became clear, for example, that the service was “asking for a lot in this phase of the program,” Cummings said, and so the Army is evaluating what really needs to be in the RFP and what can wait to avoid detracting from key attributes like an open architecture.\\nOther industry feedback, he said, included concerns “about ensuring that foreign competition is there.”\\nIt appears likely that American firm Raytheon and German company Rheinmetall will team up again to submit a design, as well as General Dynamics Land Systems, which was the only company to submit a physical bid sample in the previous competitive effort. BAE Systems has not publicly said whether it plans to compete this time, but the company chose months before bid samples were due that it wouldn’t compete during the previous effort.\\nFive contracts will be awarded in June 2021. A production decision is expected in 2027, with a subsequent fielding goal of 2028. The previous competition had a fielding goal of 2026.\\n“The Army shall succeed at moving forward with OMFV,” Bruce Jette, the Army’s acquisition chief, told Defense News in an interview earlier this month, implying that the service has no choice but to get a Bradley replacement right this time if it’s to appropriately modernize.\\n“We have a current schedule,” he said. “It is based upon our current objectives and funding profile. If, at any time, the senior leaders of the Army determine that modifications to that will provide greater flexibility or design development, they can make those decisions, but we are on plan and currently moving forward with the end date of 2028.”\\nWASHINGTON — In the future operational environment, up against near-peer adversaries, the U.S. Army will be expected to be able to operate in smaller, more dispersed units far away from well-established military posts that offer creature comforts as well as essentials like fuel, water, ammunition and energy. \\n \\nSo the service is crafting a strategy to reduce the logistics tails for units expected to operate at the tactical edge.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think we are going to have the luxury of having this massive amount of logistics behind us in future higher-end, higher-intensity conflicts, in my view,\" Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said at a May 4 Atlantic Council event in Washington.\\n \\nThe Army\\'s relatively new war fighting concept — multi-domain battle — acknowledges the battlefield is interconnected across domains from space to land to air to sea and even to cyberspace. The battlefield is expanding not just across geographic space but also the electromagnetic and cyber spectrums. Adversaries will be more closely matched in capability with U.S. forces and therefore smaller units will be expected to maneuver quickly semi-independently from larger formations during small windows of advantage.\\n\\nThis means dragging a massive amount of stuff needed to sustain a unit isn\\'t going to be possible, but soldiers still need water, fuel, power and equipment to survive and operate. The service is taking a hard look at how to reconcile such a conundrum through a concept it is calling demand reduction.\\n\\nThe Army Capabilities Integration Center held a demand reduction summit last month to help inform the strategy it is developing to address reducing the sustainment and logistics tail of the Army in multi-domain battle.\\n\\nThe goal is to \"improve our ability to maintain freedom of movement in action during sustained and high [operational tempo] operations especially at the end of extended lines of communication in austere environments,\" Col. Stephanie Gradford, the ARCIC Sustainment Division chief, told reporters in a teleconference May 2.\\n\\nAs the Army and the Marine Corps examine multi-domain battle, they are \"recognizing that reducing vulnerabilities inherent in deployment and sustainment activities also supports resiliency of U.S. forces,\" she said. \"We must pursue demand reduction efforts to create units needing less fuel, energy, water and other supplies.\"\\n\\nThe Army doesn\\'t see reducing supplies and logistics as taking away capability from the force but rather as a \"combat enabler that extends and enhances a brigade combat team\\'s ability to maintain a pace and tempo the enemy cannot sustain,\" Gradford said.\\n\\nARCIC is tapping into technologies gaining momentum in the commercial and military worlds to help reduce logistics from additive manufacturing and 3-D printing to alternate fuels and advanced power generation to autonomy and artificial intelligence and even laser weapons to reduce the amount of ammunition needed on the battlefield.\\n\\nThe Army sees near-term promise in a variety of technologies that could reduce and streamline logistics on the battlefield, according to Col. Mark Simerly, Combined Arms Support Command Capability Development and Integration chief.\\n\\n\"For instance, the Army\\'s fuel automated management system,\" Simerly said, \"this is a capability that is going to allow us to understand how much fuel we have, where it is, and then be more precise in our understanding of how far our operations can extend and are better able to reprogram some of our resupply folks.\"\\n\\nThe Army also sees near-term promise in additive manufacturing \"to reduce demand at the point of need and allow us to produce combat spares or other critical items near the point of need or point of repair so we won\\'t need to have a reliance of a supply chain that can be over-extended,\" Simerly said.\\n\\nTactical power generation and micro-grid technology are also developed to the point where such capability could be incorporated into operations in the near-term, he added.\\n\\nFarther afield, the service envisions incorporating alternative sources of energy such as hydrogen. While the technology is available now, it likely won\\'t be integrated into combat vehicles until the mid- or long-term, Simerly noted.\\n\\nMilley said at the Atlantic Council event that the Army relies on carbon-based fuel and that will likely remain the primary fuel for the time being. \"Carbon-based fuels are here today and it is unlikely in terms of scale and scope that we will transform the U.S. military to something other than that in the near future -- defined as inside of 10 years,\" he said.\\n\\nWhile alternative power-generation exists now from electric cars to nuclear powered naval vessels, alternative fuels aren\\'t ready for prime time when it comes to large-scale Army use, Milley said, adding the service is doing a lot of research on it.\\n\\nFor instance, the U.S. Army\\'s Tank Automotive Research Development and Engineering Center and General Motors have partnered to build a hydrogen cell-powered demonstrator and are bringing the technology to soldiers for testing over the course of this year.\\nAutonomous distribution of supplies, particularly from the air, would also come later down the road, Simerly noted. Platforms that can deliver supplies 110 to 150 kilometers out with a payload up to 1,500 or 2,000 lbs \"probably wouldn’t be available until the mid-term and potentially the far-term depending upon the advancements of certain artificial intelligence technologies that allow them to be fully autonomous,\" he said.\\nThe Army will experiment near-term capabilities likely to play a part in the demand reduction strategy at the Joint Warfighting Assessment in Germany next year in late April and early May.\\nAmong the capabilities are additive manufacturing, small unit water purification, microgrids, the Joint Tactical Autonomous Aerial Resupply System (JTARS) and a tactical power management concept, according to Gradford.\\nThe Army Research Laboratory and industry is working on a futuristic concept for aerial resupply — a small rectangular-shaped quadcopter called the Joint Tactical Aerial Resupply Vehicle or \"hoverbike\" — that could order and receive supplies to the battlefield rapidly.\\nAlso underway is a three-month maneuver support exercise at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, where a semi-autonomous, leader-follower concept will be demonstrated for cargo resupply. Several unmanned tactical vehicles in a convoy will be equipped with sensors that allow it to autonomously follow a manned vehicle, Gradford said.\\nThe demand reduction strategy is expected to be completed by the end of the year, Gradford noted, with last month’s summit serving as the first stepping stone in the process of shaping concepts for the final document.\\nHELSINKI — Nordic defense firms are buying each other up as they vie for a greater share of potential contracts that could come with increased cybersecurity funding among the region’s armed forces.\\nThe mergers and acquisitions are taking place as Sweden seeks NATO membership, and neighboring Finland this year joined the alliance.\\nCombined, according to defense spending plans, the Nordic states of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden are to invest more than $2 billion to upgrade their respective military and national security cyber defenses over the next three years.\\nMeanwhile, cybersecurity companies are also forming strategic partnerships with the regional armed forces. For example, the Norwegian firm Atea won a two-year information technology and cybersecurity services contract worth $45 million from the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) and the Norwegian National Security Authority (NSM).\\nThe former is responsible for Norway’s defense research and development efforts, and the latter serves as the country’s national intelligence agency. FFI also operates as a procurement agency for the property-focused Norwegian Defence Estates Agency, the Norwegian Armed Forces and the NSM.\\nAtea signed the first segment of the two-part deal, with a two-year option, in June 2022. The second part of the deal was inked in April 2023. The contract covers the delivery of hardware, software, IT and network cyber defense solutions, and consultancy services.\\n“The deal reflects the greater emphasis on IT network and infrastructure security in national defense areas. The contract reinforces our positive and developing relationship with the defense sector,” said Steinar Sønsteby, CEO of Atea.\\nThe appetite for strategic corporate partners in the Nordic cybersecurity domain gained momentum in 2022 following a far-reaching nonequity collaborative agreement between Finnish software specialist Digia and Danish cybersecurity technologies provider Arbit Cyber Defence Systems.\\nThe collaboration was instrumental in securing a $6 million contract to build a protected information-exchange gateway for the Finnish Defence Forces, said Jussi Tammelin, the director of Digia’s defense unit.\\nThe contract includes the supply of a secure information-exchange gateway communication solution, as well as software and equipment. The technology is based on Digia’s Linja software and Arbit’s data diode.\\n“Our collaboration with Arbit reinforces the capabilities of our defense and security sector services in the Nordic countries. International cooperation improves the competitiveness of both companies when it comes to defense sector tenders and increases defense sector exports,” Tammelin told Defense News.\\nIn 2022, Digia accelerated its plan to establish a dedicated defense unit, after it became clear Sweden and Finland intended to apply for NATO membership.\\nNordic countries must do more to strengthen their cybersecurity against increasing threats, said Natasha Friis Saxberg, the CEO of Danish ICT Industry Association, a trade organization representing information and communication technology firms.\\nAccording to Saxberg, the pooling of Nordic skill sets in this area, driven by the wave of cybersecurity mergers and acquisitions, is beneficial to developing a deeper pan-Nordic expertise to counter cyberthreats.\\n“A significant number of the cyberattacks emanating from Russia and linked to the invasion of Ukraine are directed at Denmark and the other Nordic countries. Today, cyberthreats play a significant role in every war and conflict, and therefore it is necessary to invest in cybersecurity and make it a central element of our defense,” Saxberg told Defense News\\nAcquisitions — such as Swedish firm Lyvia’s takeover of Polish company IT Systems and Solution — underline a trend where major players in the Nordic cybersecurity space with the financial means are looking to use such purchases to consolidate the market and accelerate regional growth. That acquisition by Lyvia is expected to help the company gain greater access to even larger contracts in the defense and national security sphere.\\nThe purchase also improves Lyvia’s reach in to the Baltic region as well as Central and Eastern Europe, according to Oleksandr Fomenko, who leads the business’s Central and Eastern European division.\\n“We want to expand in this high-growth sector. ITSS is a large player in a fast-growing industry with top-drawer, end-to-end cybersecurity services and impressive IT infrastructure modernization resources,” Fomenko told Defense News.\\nSimilarly, Norwegian cybersecurity company DNV’s $107 million purchase of Finnish firm Nixu was motivated by a desire to win more contracts, while taking advantage of increasing investments by Nordic governments to upgrade and maintain next-generation cyber defenses and more reliable IT infrastructure.\\nDNV’s cybersecurity expertise has historically focused on high-security areas in energy, maritime, telecommunications and financial services. “By joining forces with Nixu, we will make cyberspace a more secure place with greater impact than either company could achieve alone,” said Remi Eriksen, DNV’s chief executive.\\nOther industrial acquisitions in the region included Sweden’s Truesec buying Danish firm Venzo Cyber Security. And Ireland-based Integrity360 acquired Sweden’s Netsecure. In Denmark, Columbus purchased ICY Security, while in neighboring Norway, Netsecurity acquired Data Equipment to create a new cybersecurity group with revenues of $74 million.\\nThe acquisition of Venzo will allow Truesec to strengthen its cybersecurity offerings to both the corporate and national defense sectors in Denmark and the wider Nordic region, said Anna Averud, Truesec’s chief executive.\\n“The acquisition significantly enhances our cyber defense capabilities. It expands our capability to better defend cyberattacks. The pooling of our cyberspecialists with Venzo will make a significant difference in creating a safer society for all organizations in Denmark and Northern Europe,” Averud told Defense News.\\nHELSINKI — Sweden’s half-year rotating presidency of the European Union, which began on Jan. 1, is shaped to deliver a sharper focus on the need to deepen collaboration among member states in the key areas of defense capabilities and joint military procurements.\\nSwedish prime minister Ulf Kristersson’s Moderate-led coalition government, which was elected to office after parliamentary elections in September 2022, has identified “unity of purpose” and the strengthening of European defense readiness and capacities as primary targets during the term of its presidency.\\nSweden, against the backdrop of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, favors solutions that can advance the collective defense of Europe using weapons and allied military equipment that are not only made in the EU but acquired under joint procurement arrangements.\\nThe framework for Sweden’s presidency prioritizes continued EU economic and military support for Ukraine. A longstanding target of hostile threats from Moscow, Sweden embodies the Nordic view that Ukraine’s success in its war efforts against Russia is paramount to building a robust European security and defense policy.\\nSweden is using the EU’s Strategic Compass, which is tailored to provide a shared strategic threat assessment of the challenges the bloc faces, as its guiding light. In particular, Stockholm is keen to deepen EU defense cooperation with NATO and develop a long-term capital investment program to bolster European defense.\\nAchieving a more meaningful level of pan-EU collaboration within the cybersecurity domain has emerged as one of Sweden’s critical targets. This goal gained traction on Jan. 3, when the European Commission (EC) presented a far-reaching Joint Communication (JC) for an EU common cyber defense policy to the European Parliament.\\nThe proposal would help boost the bloc’s cyber defense posture, said Pål Jonson, Sweden’s defense minister.\\n“The ambition is to strengthen the EU’s cyber defense capabilities, as well as give individual states the tools to conduct joint cyber operations. It will also improve inter-state coordination, information sharing and interoperability between cyber security and cyber defense, including between the civil and military cyber communities,” said Jonson.\\nPARIS — Romania plans to ramp up its drone arsenal, following up a recent purchase of Turkish TB2s with an initial order for three aircraft from Israel’s Elbit Systems, valued at $180 million.\\nAt the 2023 iteration of the Paris Air Show here, the company announced Romania as the latest customer of its Watchkeeper X system. The contract was signed as part of a framework agreement finalized in December, and it will see Elbit deliver three initial unmanned aerial systems by 2025, with the possibility to provide four additional ones later.\\nThe drones will be an upgraded version of the Watchkeeper X, integrated with add-on capabilities, including the Spectro XR multi-spectral, electro-optical payload as well as new communications and radar features.\\nSpeaking to Defense News, Amir Bettesh, vice president of UAS marketing and business development at Elbit, explained that as part of the framework agreement part of the production of the Watchkeepers will be carried out in Romania and involve local partners.\\n“We view this opportunity as a gate to selling our systems to other NATO countries, especially in Europe, where we are seeing an important increase in the demand” for drones of that size, he said.\\nThe Watchkeeper X is a dual-payload drone that can be used to carry out intelligence and reconnaissance missions, providing maritime and land surveillance as well. It is the UK export variant of a British Army model, produced by a joint venture between Elbit and Thales UK, and based on the Israeli Hermes series.\\nThe UK has faced a number of issues with the Watchkeeper X program, with government officials pointing out that in 2020 only 13 of the 45-strong drone fleet had flown that year. Prior to this, between 2017 and 2018, three of them crashed in different parts of the country.\\nWhen asked about these problems, the Elbit executive called them “common challenges” faced by the majority of countries operating aerial drones.\\nIt was only a few weeks ago that Romania announced that it was acquiring TB2 drones from Turkish manufacturer Baykar, showing a willingness to diversify its suppliers.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Army is seeking to power its brigades using electric and hybrid sources in order to break free of the burden of fuel and disposable batteries that bog down its logistics tail and limit mobility and reach, a general with Army Futures Command has told Defense News.\\nLt. Gen. Eric Wesley, the director of the Futures and Concepts Center within the command, said in a recent interview that it’s one thing to power a vehicle electrically, but quite another to work out an entire enterprise that would support fleets of electric vehicles and other capabilities.\\n“Let’s be clear. We’re behind. We’re late to meet on this thing,” Wesley said. “If you look at all of the analysis, all of the various nations that we work with, they’re all going to electric power with their automotive fleet, and right now, although we do [science and technology] and we’ve got some research and development going on and we can build prototypes, in terms of a transition plan, we are not there.”\\nFor instance, the Army tested a hybrid Chevy Colorado — fitted with a hydrogen fuel cell and electric drive — with several units, but nothing amounted to the effort.\\nBuying an all-electric Tesla vehicle, Wesley said, is easy, but “the Army has to think about it much bigger. What is the cost of replacing your entire fleet? We know we can’t do that. There’s got to be a steady transition.”\\nThere will likely be a time where vehicles that use fossil fuel and ones that are all-electric share the battlefield. “What is the distribution plan that enables that?” Wesley wondered. “That is much more complex when you look at the implications for an entire enterprise.”\\nSo Wesley’s outfit is preparing a proposal for the head of Army Futures Command that will address how the service might accomplish such a big, but important endeavor that could change the paradigm of the logistics and sustainment tails as well as enhance force mobility.\\nThe proposal will make a business case for the Army electrifying the formation, discuss the technical feasibility and describe how a transition process.\\nThere are three major reasons it’s important the Army embark on this now as opposed to just dabbling with electrification capability, Wesley said. The service knows it must build a fleet more reliant on electric power than fossil fuels. While the Army previously dealt with prototypes and knows it can make electric vehicles, the service must get its arms around the capability “in a much more holistic way,” Wesley stressed, and that will take time to work out.\\nThe entire automotive industry is going electric, Wesley said, so the Army will have to do the same or risk problems with resources and supply chains down the line; if industry no longer builds parts for fossil fuel-reliant vehicles, availability of those parts will diminish and their cost will increase.\\nThe Army also views electrically powered brigades as advantageous when considering how it expects to operate in the future. The service’s emerging doctrine Multi-Domain Operations requires units to operate distributed and independently for longer periods of time in potentially contested environments.\\n“We have to operate distributed, which means you have to have organic power that is readily available,” Wesley said. “Another aspect of Multi-Domain Operations … when you think about it, a lot of technology is being distributed at lower and lower echelons, and the question is always: ‘How are we going to power these different tools that we use in operations, highly technical tools, that we use to integrate domains? How are you going to power those?’\\n“Electrification allows you to have access to readily available power to distribute not only for the vehicle but for all those different systems that I have.”\\nAnd other benefits abound, he added, including dealing with less parts. The general noted that a Tesla’s moving parts are a few dozen while the number of moving parts in an internal combustion engine can be in the thousands. In the electric vehicle, the parts are also modular and don’t break down due to interaction with each other, but rather individual failures, Wesley said, so that means broken parts can easily be replaced.\\nIn addition, batteries from one vehicle to another would be similar or exactly the same, so parts across the fleet would have more commonality, he said. Electric vehicles are also quiet and have a low heat signature, which means they are less likely to be detected by opposing forces, he added.\\nWhile a transition to electrically powered brigades would have a substantial price tag, the cost of one would be much lower than the cost to power the brigade with fossil fuel now, he argued.\\nThe Army is also considering powering its capabilities with other forms of energy such as nuclear power — a technological leap that isn’t far off, according to Wesley.\\nThe Pentagon is investing roughly $400 million across the next five years in an attempt to develop prototypes for mobile nuclear power. The idea is to “pelletize” nuclear fuel encased in such a manner “to preclude the escape of radioactivity that allows you to leverage nuclear fission in such a way that it becomes safe,” Wesley explained.\\nThe three-star general said there are at least nine vendors interested in building a prototype that could be built in the next two to three years, which would provide enough power to provide energy to an entire forward-operating base for an extended period of time.\\n“Imagine a mobile nuclear power capability that can fit on the back of a truck. Now you’re generating your own energy.”\\nAURORA, Colorado — The Air Force is ramping up plans for incorporating drone wingmen into its fleet, and envisions 1,000 of the so-called collaborative combat aircraft in service as it sketches out ideas.\\nAir Force Secretary Frank Kendall said Tuesday that the service will ask Congress for funding in the fiscal 2024 budget to move forward with the CCA program, as well as the Next Generation Air Dominance program of futuristic fighter aircraft, so it can map out how it will operate, organize and support these new systems.\\nIn his keynote address at the Air and Space Force Association’s AFA Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colorado, Tuesday, Kendall said he and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown told planners to assume the service might acquire 1,000 CCAs. Under this model, the Air Force would acquire two CCAs for each of 200 NGAD platforms, and two for each of 300 F-35s, Kendall said.\\nKendall cautioned those numbers aren’t likely to be what the Air Force’s inventory ends up tallying. Instead, he said, it’s a ballpark estimate to allow the service to estimate its basing needs, organizational structures, training and range requirements, and sustainment concepts.\\n“The CCAs will complement and enhance the performance of our crewed fighter force structure,” Kendall said. “CCAs will dramatically improve the performance of our crewed aircraft, and significantly reduce the risk to our pilots.”\\nKendall has made adopting autonomous CCAs into the Air Force’s future fleet one of his top priorities as he seeks to update its fighter fleet to win a future war.\\nThese drones could carry out a variety of missions, including striking targets, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, or electronic warfare, Brown said in a February talk at the Brookings Institution.\\nThe Air Force envisions these drones as being less expensive than traditional crewed aircraft, and in some cases being cheap enough that the service could afford to lose them in combat. This would allow the Air Force to send CCAs on riskier missions, and avoid putting human pilots in danger.\\nKendall stressed in his speech that adopting drone wingmen will not mean the Air Force has fewer crewed fighters in its inventory. Instead, he said, CCAs can be thought of as remotely controlled versions of the targeting or electronic warfare pods or weapons that crewed aircraft now carry.\\nIn a roundtable discussion with reporters at the conference, Kendall said the Air Force wants CCAs to cost a fraction of the F-35, which costs roughly $78 million per air frame in its 14th lot. He said affordability is a requirement for the program.\\nKendall said the CCA program will be one of nearly 20 new or significantly ramped up programs in the upcoming budget request. About a dozen of those will be new starts that will require Congress’ approval, he said, and the rest are enhancements to already existing programs such as the Advanced Battle Management System.\\nKendall said in September 2022 that he hopes the Air Force will hold a competition for CCAs in 2024, though details on that competition are scarce.\\nBrown said in another roundtable Tuesday that the Air Force has three lines of effort under way to develop CCAs: Developing the platform itself, developing the autonomous software that will fly the CCA, and figuring out how to organize, train, equip and supply the program.\\nAll three of those efforts are under way “in parallel,” Brown said. The Air Force has brought in operators and maintainers to figure out questions such as how the CCAs would be directed and controlled during operations, he said.\\nPart of that work is figuring out how to design and mature the drone’s autonomous core, so a fighter pilot doesn’t get overwhelmed with the responsibility of directing and guiding the CCA, Brown said. That includes doing experiments on autonomy with the X-62A Variable In-flight Simulator Aircraft, or VISTA, a heavily modified F-16 fighter at Edwards Air Force Base in California\\n“There’s a number of ways to do this, whether it’s voice [commands] or touchscreen,” Brown said. “Just think about our day-to-day lives, and the autonomy we have. So the technology is there. It’s just how we bring this into our military applications.”\\nWASHINGTON — After spending years at the U.S. Army’s one-stop shop for everything related to electronic warfare and sensor development, including a stint as boss, Mark Kitz is moving on.\\nKitz on June 23 was named the next leader of the service’s Program Executive Office Command, Control and Communications-Tactical, or PEO C3T. He’ll succeed Maj. Gen. Anthony Potts, formerly of PEO Soldier, who took the post last year.\\nThe change means Kitz is trading missile warning suites, aerial jammers and biometric tools — the bread and butter of PEO Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors, or PEO IEW&S — for radios, satellite connectivity and networking upgrades once recognized as capability sets.\\nIn an interview with C4ISRNET on June 23, Kitz reflected on the state of Army electronic warfare, the service’s ongoing reorganization of cyber and networking programs, and some of his accomplishments.\\nThis interview was edited for length and clarity.\\nHow has the Army’s electronic warfare environment changed during your time at PEO IEW&S? Is the service on the right track? What are your parting recommendations?\\nI came to PEO IEW&S 12 years ago. I was originally working intel, intel processing, and then migrated toward the electronic warfare portfolio.\\nIn the time when I started at the PEO, our investment in electronic warfare was very nascent: significant investment in counter-improvised explosive devices — specifically radio-controlled counter-IED — getting after remote triggers to threats to our forces, especially ground combat forces. So CREW Duke devices.\\nAll of our electronic warfare investments were very reactionary. The threat is developing or delivering a capability, and our electronic warfare investments were to counter that threat or to counter that capability.\\nOver the last three years, we’ve seen a significant investment by our adversaries in affecting the battlespace and spectrum. Jamming and spoofing, and in a much more surgical way. I’ll use counter-GPS as an example. In Ukraine now, you’re seeing significant investment in small form factor, surgical ways to deny GPS, which is a significant event if you’re operating without that capability.\\nOver the last three years, the most significant acknowledgement and investment has been that the U.S. Army can, and needs to, build windows of opportunity by being active in the spectrum. That’s both from collection and from electronic attack.\\nBut we’ve got a lot more to learn. We’ve invested in programs like Terrestrial Layer System. We’ve invested in programs like Multi-Function Electronic Warfare-Air Large, which is an aerial-based electronic attack system.\\nWe need to be able to get these systems in the hands of units so they can exercise, operate and learn how these active, non-kinetic ways to affect the operation will actually affect the way they operate.\\nI think there’s a significant investment in building these windows of opportunity — but a lot more work to do in how to operate that, how that’ll be effective, and how we’ll move and be an effective force with our electronic warfare equipment.\\nDescribe “deep sensing,” and explain the Army’s interest in it. How will that evolve over the next few years?\\nSecretary of the Army Christine Wormuth covers this quite a bit in her remarks. We are investing significantly in long-range fires — Extended Range Cannon Artillery, hypersonics, you name it — and so is the rest of the world. In order to effectively conduct long-range fires, you have to understand the situation. Especially based on our rules of engagement, you have to have a very robust understanding of the environment that you’re going to fire into.\\nIn simplistic terms it is we, as a country, who need to understand the environment that we’re going to operate in as robustly as possible from as far away as possible. That’s critical: not putting any of our systems or soldiers at risk, and doing it in a way that we can understand the operating space at very long distances, especially when you look at Indo-Pacific Command, especially when you look at the target environment in Ukraine. We’re talking about very-long-range targeting situations. We’ve got to be able to sense much farther than our target systems can, and much farther than our adversary, and understand that environment.\\nIn very lay terms, it’s really being able to see farther than we can shoot, and see farther than they can shoot. It takes complicated systems to do that. It takes a joint service investment between us, the Air Force and the Navy, and being able to collaborate.\\nThat’s why you see the joint services talk a lot about Joint All-Domain Command and Control — collaborating on our data, understanding how we’re collecting our data and using that data to build out a really robust environment for our commanders.\\nWhat will be the impact of the Army’s reorganization of cyber and network projects within the PEOs IEW&S, C3T and Enterprise Information Systems? What additional realignments do you anticipate?\\nIt’s very timely for the Army to realign how we’re doing cyber because of the recent National Defense Authorization Act language establishing a PEO at Cyber Command. Cyber Command is really taking a forward-leaning approach in integrating cyber capabilities, whether it’s defensive, offensive, cybersecurity and hygiene, or infrastructure. Cyber Command and Congress are really acknowledging the fact that we must integrate across our cyber enterprise to achieve this Joint Cyber Warfighting Architecture.\\nIt’s natural that the Army, taking Cyber Command’s lead, is looking at how to better integrate our cyber capabilities in our acquisition community.\\nDefensive was at PEO EIS. Offensive is at PEO IEW&S. I think integrating those two under the same acquisition command, building synergies across the technologies — when you look at the development networks and the cloud infrastructures that we’re building on the offensive side, they very clearly relate to the defensive side.\\nHaving Cyber Command focus on integration, it’s just natural for the Army to follow their lead and really deliver integrated capabilities to both Army cyber warfighters and our joint service cyber warfighters.\\nAnd lastly, both PEOs EIS and IEW&S have a long history of supporting cyber operations. Cyber Command is acknowledging that the Army is a significant contributor to the Joint Cyber Warfighting Architecture. By integrating across our two PEOs, we will be able to provide a better and more integrated service to our Cyber Command customers.\\nIn May, you said you were nervous about the scope and ambition of Project Linchpin, an artificial intelligence effort. Elaborate on that. Are you still worried?\\nSo a quick update on Project Linchpin: We forged a very robust relationship with the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office.\\nWith Dr. Craig Martell, [the Defense Department’s chief digital and AI officer], and Joe Larson, [a deputy at the office focused on algorithmic warfare], our team forged this really close partnership because the Office of the Secretary of Defense has [acknowledged] sensor data is critical to how we’re going to conduct a future involving AI and machine learning, has recognized the Army can’t do it alone.\\nThis very close partnership with CDAO has definitely assuaged my concerns about building out the scope of Linchpin because I know IEW&S could not do it alone.\\nSensor data is ubiquitous, across every PEO, across every area, across every service. Being able to scope Linchpin to very specific tasks or problems was always going to be a hard proposition. We were very recently with the Army acquisition executive, and we’re building out an initial plan over the next two years, with this partnership with CDAO, focused on sensor data problems, looking at long-range sensing and our specific platforms for long-range sensing.\\nWe’ve got very strong Army leadership support for scoping Linchpin around sensor data and, specifically, our long-range sensing data from aerial platforms.\\nYes, I think we’ve done a lot to mitigate my concerns about making sure we scope Linchpin appropriately. But there’s always going to be this natural expectation that AI is going to solve X number of problems instantly for us. We’ve got to deliberately build out that infrastructure and take it one problem at a time, one issue at a time, one program at a time.\\nWhat programs hit major milestones during your time as the boss at PEO IEW&S? What are you most proud of accomplishing?\\nThere are two programs that I would highlight. One is sort of a combination of programs, but in our assured position, navigation and timing portfolio, we’ve had a bunch of significant milestones. I’m really proud of that.\\nI’ve been in this PEO a long time, and those programs have been in this PEO for a long time, too. We’ve talked about it, iterated on requirements, talked about what the right solution would be, and to get to the finish line, or to get to us delivering capability here, was a very proud moment for me and the PEO.\\nFor both our mounted and dismounted solutions, we’re now delivering assured PNT to our warfighters. Both went through robust testing with the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation office, both went through a lot of soldier touchpoints. We’ve got a lot of consensus support around both programs. I’m really proud of the PNT team and all the work that they put in to deliver a capability that we talked about and iterated on for a really long time.\\nAnother one that I’m proud of — and we’ve still got a lot of work to do — is in our third-generation FLIR portfolio.\\nWe built the absolute best forward-looking infrared system in the world. It’s going to help define how we operate our future ground combat platforms and how we do scout operations. This is extremely complicated. It was an extremely ambitious program. To be in production of this program was a really proud moment for me and the team, and it involved close partnerships with the labs and with industry.\\nIn my tenure, I’m just really proud of the people and progress that happened at the PEO while I was there. I made some really strong friendships and connections in my time at the PEO. I’m just really grateful and humbled that I was able to lead such a high-performing organization. I had a lot of fun.\\nWhere are you headed next? What’s that change going to be like for you?\\nI’m headed to PEO C3T.\\nIt’s great: For me, I started my career in satellite communications with an intel communication program, so my background has been on radio frequency engineering from my early career. I’m really excited about taking over a really high-performing organization that brings me back to my roots, in terms of communication systems.\\nCandidly, it’s really going to challenge me and both my technical skills and leadership, and I’m really looking forward to that challenge. I’ve been at PEO IEW&S for a really, really long time. I got to do, essentially, my dream job for the last two years. I’m very humbled that the Army has chosen me to take a new challenge, and I’m ready for a new challenge.\\nIt’ll be a lot of fun. My family and I are really fortunate to be able to stay at Aberdeen Proving Ground and to continue to serve in the Army.\\nWASHINGTON — House appropriators want the Space Force to try out a new budgeting approach that could give the service more flexibility to shift funding as needs change and threats arise.\\nThe House Appropriations Committee’s fiscal 2024 defense spending bill includes a provision directing the service to submit a supplementary exhibit next year that consolidates budget lines for each of its programs into mission-area portfolios.\\nLawmakers expect the move would give greater insight into how the service’s capabilities align with the National Defense Strategy and give the Space Force flexibility to move funding around within those portfolios. The measure would be a trial for the fiscal 2025 budget cycle but could be continued and expanded across the Department of Defense in future years.\\n“The committee recognizes there may be potential benefits to an approach that more directly connects national security strategy and goals to the Department’s budget priorities, program plans, and ultimately to capabilities,” the committee said in a report accompanying its bill. “Such an approach may also bring greater transparency and accuracy to the true total cost and resources needed to accomplish mission goals.”\\nThe provision echoes proposals from former and current DoD officials, including the Space Force.\\nFollowing the creation of the service in 2019, Space Force leaders submitted a report to Congress detailing recommended reforms to the acquisition system. Chief among those proposals was to consolidate budget items based on mission areas.\\n“The primary benefits are enabling rapid responses to emergent threats in the year of execution that drive a need for realignment of funds and increase overall space purchasing power,” the Space Force said in the 2020 report.\\nAn Atlantic Council commission of defense experts, convened to consider how the department can better integrate new technology into its arsenal, included a similar recommendation in an interim report released in April.\\nThe Commission on Defense Innovation and Adoption, which includes former leaders like Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James and Defense Secretary Mark Esper, suggested that Congress should authorize DoD to begin implementing the model in fiscal 2024.\\n“DoD should adapt the way it conducts its acquisition programs to provide additional flexibility in the year of execution, and Congress can authorize that flexibility,” it said. “Congress should appropriate money to DoD with fewer but larger discrete budget line items and reset reprogramming authorities so that acquisition professionals have greater flexibility.”\\nFor the FY24 Space Force pilot effort, House appropriators want the service to include a “clear statement” of its plans for each mission area, justification for its budget request and details on the civilian and military personnel needed to support each portfolio.\\nThe bill also calls for the Space Force to submit a draft plan for the budget exhibit by September of this year.\\nUPDATE — This story has been updated to include that Mettle Ops has submitted a bid and a comment from its founder.\\nWASHINGTON — The deadline to submit a preliminary design for the Army’s Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) is April 16, but the cutoff marks not the time for industry officials to put pencils down, but rather the time to pick them up.\\nAmong the companies that have announced bid submissions or intentions to compete are prime defense contractors General Dynamics Land Systems, BAE Systems and a Rheinmetall North America-led team to include Raytheon, Textron and L3Harris.\\nOshkosh Defense has also submitted a bid as a prime contractor and is partnering with leading South Korean defense company Hanwha, sources familiar with the effort have confirmed to Defense News.\\nAlso according to several other sources, Michigan-based Mettle Ops has submitted a bid. The company “specializes in research, development, reverse engineering, program management, ground vehicle design, test and evaluation experience, system integration capabilities, and facilitates manufacturing and fabrication,” according to its website. It is owned by Katie and Mark Bigelow, a husband and wife team who both served in the Army.\\n“We are pushing hard toward autonomy, hybrid electric, and robotics. We know we are the underdog, but that’s not going stop us,” Katie Bigelow, Mettle Ops president and founder, told Defense News. The company has one subcontract in autonomy and is in the process of finalizing an award for an autonomous, hybrid electric vehicle design as well, she added.\\nOther bid announcements could surface as the deadline looms — likely from small and non-traditional businesses.\\nA year and a half ago, the Army received just one physical bid sample from GDLS by its set deadline in October 2019. Defense News broke the news that the only other entry — the Lynx 41 from a Rheinmetall and Raytheon team — was disqualified because it wasn’t delivered to Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, on time.\\nBut the writing was already on the wall that the OMFV’s development schedule and requirements had doomed the program when BAE Systems, which manufactures the Bradley, bowed out of the competition months before the deadline.\\nInstead of moving forward with just one option, the Army canceled its OMFV competition, and took a step back to come up with a plan that would better foster a robust competition over a more reasonable timeline.\\nThe Army not only dropped the plan to require a physical bid sample at the outset, it instead mapped out a five-phased effort that begins with an initial design phase then moves into a detailed design phase, followed by prototyping, testing and production.\\nThose designs will inform the Abbreviated-Concept Development Document (A-CDD) expected to be published in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\\n“One of the neat elements of this initial phase of the program is that the Army isn’t asking us for the answer,” Don Kotchman, GDLS’ general manager, told Defense News in an April 15 interview.\\n“The Army is asking us how are we going to approach developing the answer,” he said.\\nWhoever is selected, Kotchman added, will be chosen because the Army likes the approach for its “adaptability, flexibility, robustness.”\\nThe service will choose five prime contractor teams to design rough digital prototypes. The Army will then award up to three contracts for a detailed design and prototype phase that will include options for low-rate initial production. The service will select one vendor to go into production.\\nWhile it was widely believed BAE Systems would submit a bid, the company waited until April 15 to make it official. The company said in a statement that it would team with Elbit Systems and others. The announcement comes as little surprise since BAE said in October 2020 that it would team with Elbit on combat vehicle technology without stating explicitly that it would team up on OMFV.\\nGeneral Dynamics is assembling its team and has already brought Silicon Valley-based Applied Intuition and Simi Valley, California-based Aerovironment on board. Applied Intuition is a company focused on autonomy and simulated vehicle development.\\n“The approach that General Dynamics Land Systems has taken to execute this is to find innovative partners who are really focused on the transformative capabilities that [the Army] is looking for in OMFV,” Kotchman said. “It really deals with the intellectual underpinnings of artificial intelligence, data management, sensor integration kinds of things so that regardless of eventual hardware approach, the ability for our offering to adapt, synthesize and deliver capability is enhanced.”\\nRheinmetall NA and its Raytheon, Textron and L3Harris team has been vocal about its plans to bid.\\nL3 Technologies is the most recent addition to the team and announced April 14 its teaming agreement with Rheinmetall NA to jointly develop OMFV. L3Harris will provide vehicle mission systems, cybersecurity and its modular open systems approach for the Lynx, a company statement read.\\n“We have a long history providing similar support to multiple platforms using our [modular open-systems architecture] approach for mission systems and electronic warfare,” James Gear, vice president for L3Harris’ domestic business development, said in the statement. “We look forward to working with American Rheinmetall Vehicles to further expand into the ground defense vehicle market.”\\nThe service plans to spend $4.6 billion from fiscal 2022 through FY26 on OMFV so it is turning to industry input earlier and more than ever.\\nFollowing the concept design phase, the Army will move into a detailed design phase that will be executed over the course of FY23 and FY24.\\nThe prototyping phase will begin in FY25 and vehicle testing will begin in FY26 and wrap up the following year with a production decision planned for the fourth quarter of FY27. Full-rate production is expected to begin in the second quarter of FY30.\\nIn parallel to the concept design phase, the Army will develop an open architecture for OMFV.\\nAn open architecture has risen to the top of the OMFV planner’s list of required capability, particularly after seeing the need to be networked with other capabilities across the battlefield and at the forward edge at Project Convergence at Yuma Proving Grounds, Arizona, over the summer.\\nThe Army will establish a voluntary consortium beginning in January 2021 that will represent industry, government and academia, in order to develop such an open architecture.\\nWASHINGTON — The US Army, in its largest contract award in years, selected Oshkosh to build its Humvee replacement, the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), the Army announced Tuesday.\\nOshkosh beat out Humvee-maker AM General and defense titan Lockheed Martin to walk away with a $6.7 billion contract in low rate initial production, for a program estimated to be worth $30 billion through 2024. Three years of low-rate initial production and five years of full-rate production, are set to produce a total of 49,100 for the Army and 5,500 for the Marine Corps.\\nIn the JLTV, the Army is seeking a replacement for the Humvee that is as mobile, but with the same protection as a mine resistant ambush protected vehicle (MRAP).\\nJLTV manufacturing will be performed in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, with deliveries beginning 10 months after award. A full rate production decision is expected in fiscal 2018.\\nBefore the award, James Tinsley, managing partner of Avascent, a strategy and management consulting firm, said Oshkosh was considered cost-competitive, experienced with heavy military trucks and the middle choice between AM General and Lockheed Martin. In the competition, it was up to Oshkosh, manufacturer of the M-ATV Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle, to argue that it was already the best in the weight class.\\nOshkosh had touted its vehicle as having the protection of its M-ATV, packaged in the L-ATV, which is about one-third lighter. John Bryant, Oshkosh senior vice president of defense programs, likened its Core 1080 crew protection system to that of a race car, which allows its driver to walk away from a horrific wreck.\\nIn a confident interview before the award, Bryant cited the company\\'s experience fielding the M-ATV and its ability to transition from development to production. Bryant said the company has done this for more vehicles than its competitors and is ready to do it right away for its entry, the L-ATV, and as such offers a \"\\'no-risk seamless transition to production.\\n\"We see the Oshkosh JLTV as the most capable and survivable tactical vehicle that\\'s ever been built, and technically speaking, the Oshkosh JLTV — we\\'ve had the advantage because our M-ATV is the only vehicle performing the mission in theater right now,\" Bryant said.\\nAs part of engineering and manufacturing development contracts awarded to the three companies in 2012, each company delivered 22 prototype vehicles.\\nThe first Army unit would be equipped with the vehicles in fiscal 2018, and its acquisition would be complete in 2040. The Marine Corps would begin its buy at the start of production and finish in fiscal 2022.\\nThe award may only be the latest round in the selection process for the high stakes program, as the Army and defense executives have said they expect a formal protest, which would surely cause a delay.\\nJerry DeMuro, BAE Systems US-based CEO, said in an Aug. 1 earnings call, that after the award, \"we may go through a period of protest as is not unusual on a highly competitive program. So it will be some time before I think that one sorts it out.\" BAE Systems is a subcontractor to Lockheed on JLTV.\\nLockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson, in a January call with investors, said the award date was uncertain because, \"a lot of times protests emerge.\"\\nLt. Gen. Michael Williamson told Inside the Army earlier this month the service is bracing for a protest after after the service picks a vendor due to, \"declining resources and fewer opportunities for our vendors who have made an investment.\" In response, the Army sought to release a contract that is as \"protest-proof\" format as possible, he reportedly said.\\nFor years, the iconic Humvee has been the life\\'s blood of privately-held AM General. The company has manufactured more than 280,000 units since production began at its Mishawaka, Ind., plant in 1984. Though the Humvee has evolved several times over the years, the heavily armored MRAP came to dominance in Iraq and Afghanistan to offer better protection from improvised bombs. The JLTV will replace a third of the Army\\'s Humvee fleet.\\n\"Really, the program has always been focused on restoring a baseline level of performance, protection, mobility and transportability,\" said Army Col. Shane Fullmer, JLTV project manager.\\nArmy Col. John Cavedo, former JLTV project manager, said the survivability requirements were developed in the wake of the Iraq war. \"The threats we were seeing in theater in the 2007 timeframe helped inform that dramatically,\" he said.\\nScott Davis, chief of Army Program Executive Office Combat Support & Combat Service Support, said \"there is no expectation of a protest.\"\\nCotton, who represents the Camden location where Lockheed would have produced the JLTV, said he was \"disappointed\" in the decision and indicated a willingness to use political pressure to wrestle the award away if Lockheed seeks to protest it.\\n\"I am confident the work and infrastructure Lockheed Martin put in place to bid on this project will bring other economic benefits\" he said in a statement. \"And as Lockheed Martin explores their next steps, we stand ready to assist them however we can.\"\\nBefore the award, James Tinsley, managing partner of Avascent, a strategy and management consulting firm, said Oshkosh was considered cost-competitive, experienced with heavy military trucks and the middle choice between AM General and Lockheed Martin. In the competition, it was up to Oshkosh, manufacturer of the M-ATV Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle, to argue that it was already the best in the weight class.\\n\"We see the Oshkosh JLTV as the most capable and survivable tactical vehicle that\\'s ever been built, and technically speaking, the Oshkosh JLTV — we\\'ve had the advantage because our M-ATV is the only vehicle performing the mission in theater right now,\" Bryant said.\\nStaff Writer Aaron Mehta contributed to this report.\\nEmail: jgould@defensenews.com\\nTwitter: @reporterjoe\\nPARIS — Amid the rows of fighter aircraft, drones and helicopters at the Paris Air Show here last month, an uptick in the displays of one key class of ground-based systems stood out: the radars and launchers of missile defense.\\nFeted as the first “salon” hosted at Le Bourget Paris since the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was also the first such air show since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Since then, many of Kyiv’s neighbors and allies have rushed to donate air and missile defense systems and to take stock of their own inventories.\\nOn the sidelines of the show, European officials met to discuss the continent’s varied proposals for developing new air and missile defense systems, with Germany leading a 17-nation-strong initiative to procure off-the-shelf capabilities, and France pushing for a smaller, organic approach to building up European industry.\\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron used the forum to argue against the Berlin-led Sky Shield effort, first announced by Chancellor Olaf Scholz in October 2022, which would bring together a combination of air and missile defense systems – procured from both European and non-European companies. Specifically, German officials have cited Raytheon’s Patriot system and the Arrow 3 system developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) as key components of the Sky Shield system.\\nMacron warned at his conference against relying on non-European systems and that an “Iron Dome”-like missile defense initiative, as Israel has it, could not work for the whole continent of Europe.\\n“When we talk air defense, we would be wrong to rush into capacity. The question is, first of all, strategic,” he said June 19 at the air show, speaking to representatives from 20 European nations as well as NATO.\\n“What Ukraine shows is we can only give Kyiv what we have and produce,” he continued. “What comes from non-European countries is less manageable. It is subject to timetables, priorities and sometimes even authorizations from third countries,” he added.\\nA recent report by the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) assessed that Europe’s militaries lack sufficient systems to counter long-range guided and unguided missiles, and while militaries possess a number of short- and medium-range systems, many are dated and originally of Soviet stock.\\n“Europe’s piecemeal approach to air and missile defense at the national level is no longer a sustainable strategy,” the report said.\\nGermany’s vision for the European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI) would combine existing short-, medium-, and long-range air and missile defense systems coming from Europe, the United States, and Israel.\\nTo date, 17 European nations have committed to supporting the endeavor, including Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom. As of this article’s writing, France and Italy are unaffiliated, although German officials have asserted the door remains open for new members.\\nBut the French president’s address at the air show left little doubt that Paris is not keen to sign onto Sky Shield. Macron used the forum to announce that the Franco-Italian-built SAMP/T missile defense system was officially delivered and operational in Ukraine, following deliveries in May. “It’s really Europe protecting Europe, and thus at the heart of our project,” he said.\\nHe also announced a joint procurement by five European nations — France, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia and Hungary — of Mistral 3 air defense missiles produced by weapons-maker MBDA. Some of those nations have also committed to the Sky Shield effort.\\nThe French-led initiative will be overseen by the ministry’s procurement arm Direction Generale de l’Armement (DGA) on behalf of the partner nations. The total number of missiles to be ordered remains unconfirmed, although French defense officials stated on June 20 that it could be near 1,000.\\nMBDA did not respond to inquiries on how the missiles are to be divided between the participating nations or when the deliveries would begin. The production rate for the Mistral, which is currently 20 units per month, will climb by 40 percent – or 28 units per month – in 2024, a company spokesperson told Defense News in an email.\\nOther missile manufacturers at the show were eager for Germany’s effort to move forward. In June, lawmakers in Berlin gave the green light to approve an advance payment for the procurement of Arrow 3 components, as part of a deal that could reportedly total $4.3 billion.\\nIn an interview with Defense News, IAI’s chief executive Boaz Levy hailed the move as “a step in the right direction” to be able to deliver the systems on time.\\n“Our goal currently is to finalize and have a contract signed before the end of the year to be able to deploy the first Arrow 3s to Germany by 2025,” Levy said.\\nHe added that training would likely be a matter of “a few months,” with parts happening in Israel and Germany.\\nLevy advertised the system as complementary to Germany’s own defensive architecture. “The Arrow 3 will add another layer of protection and allow German forces to not only control their territory but also their allies and neighbors as it has a huge footprint,” he said.\\nThe system boasts a two-stage interceptor capable of targeting missiles launched more than 2,000 kilometers away.\\nSince the news first broke last year that Germany was considering the Arrow 3 system, with the country’s air force as a key proponent, experts have debated how difficult it would be to integrate a non-NATO system with European equipment.\\nCOLOGNE, Germany — Italy has become the latest country to show interest in Estonian robotics firm Milrem’s THeMIS ground vehicle, as nations across Europe continue to actively pursue the unmanned systems.\\nA photo distributed by Milrem shows the vehicle at an Italian Army base near Rome last month with its cargo hold folded wide open and the contents — a small surveillance drone made by Estonia’s Threod Systems — hovering above.\\nThe THeMIS vehicle, which is short for Tracked Hybrid Modular Infantry System, is configurable for logistics, combat, reconnaissance or explosive ordnance disposal. In its basic version, it looks something like a cabriolet tank, roughly waist-high and piano-wide.\\nThe various combat setups include weaponry such as guns, anti-tank missiles or launchers for suicide drones mounted on top, according to Milrem’s website. The company doesn’t make its own arms, a spokesman told Defense News, but rather integrates weapons from other manufacturers.\\n“Pulling the trigger is always done by the human,” the spokesman said when asked about the vehicle’s level of autonomy, adding that all weapon add-ons by third-party vendors are expected to abide by that rule.\\nThe demonstration in Italy follows a string of recent announcements by armed forces in Europe and elsewhere using the THeMIS platform for testing or operations.\\nThis spring, the Estonian Defence Forces, or EDF, completed a yearlong deployment with the vehicle during the French-led Barkhane counterterrorism mission in Mali. The vehicle accompanied soldiers on patrol and ferried supplies around the base.\\n“We collected a lot of valuable data and feedback during the deployment and although EDF’s experience with the THeMIS was positive, there is always room for improvement,” Kuldar Vaarsi, CEO of Milrem, was quoted as saying in a statement. “However, after this experience in Mali, we are confident that the THeMIS is more than capable of supporting operations in extremely hot climates.\"\\nThe company previously said it was preparing to support another deployment with the country’s forces at the end of 2020.\\nIn September, the Netherlands signed a joined procurement agreement with the Estonian government to buy seven THeMIS vehicles from Milrem — four for the Royal Netherlands Army and three for Estonian forces.\\nFor the Dutch, the purchase brings its inventory of the ground robots to six, with the two bought in 2019.\\n“So far, the THeMIS has successfully been used for research and experiments by operational units of the 13 Light Brigade in Scotland, Germany, The Netherlands and during a live fire exercise in Austria,” Lt. Col. Martijn Hadicke of the Royal Netherlands Army was quoted as saying in a company statement. “The addition of four extra THeMIS vehicles with a Remote Controlled Weapon System that is operated by a soldier provides us the opportunity to continue to develop concepts to enhance the combat power and decrease the risk for our soldiers.”\\nAlong with the most recent outreach to Italian forces, Milrem rolled out what it dubs the Intelligent Systems Implementation Analysis and Assessment program, a three-step process designed to offer governments new capability ideas for their military robotic needs.\\nThe program “provides armed forces support from initial planning to full implementation and post implementation analyses of intelligent and robotic systems with (NATO standard) concept development and experimentation methodologies,” according to Juri Pajuste, a retired Estonian military officer who now leads Milrem’s defense research and development efforts.\\nThe company is already sitting pretty when it comes to charting a course for robotic ground vehicles under the auspices of the European Union. Milrem has positioned its THeMIS vehicle as the reference platform in a multinational program aimed at developing a common design architecture underpinning future developments in the growth market.\\nThis story was updated Jan. 5, 2023, at 11:52 a.m. ET with additional statements from Pratt & Whitney and the F-35 Joint Program Office.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. military and defense contractor Pratt & Whitney have suspended deliveries of new engines for the F-35 fighter in the wake of a December mishap on a Texas runway.\\nThe F-35 Joint Program Office said in an email to Defense News that the delivery of new F135 engines was paused Dec. 27, after what the JPO described as a “mutual agreement” involving itself, the Defense Contract Management Agency and engine-maker Pratt & Whitney.\\nThe JPO said in the email that deliveries are paused while the investigation into the Dec. 15 mishap involving an F-35B continues, and as ground tests take place to identify the root cause of the accident.\\n“The F-35 Joint Program Office and Pratt & Whitney have agreed to delay scheduled delivery and acceptance of F135 engines until further information from the investigation is known and safety of flight can be ensured,” the JPO said in a follow-up email.\\nA Pratt & Whitney executive said in a statement emailed Wednesday evening that F135 deliveries were not formally suspended. The company did not immediately respond to a request to clarify its statement.\\n“There has been no formal suspension of F135 deliveries and we are working closely with the Joint Program Office on all aspects of the ongoing investigation and timing of deliveries,” said Jen Latka, vice president of F135 programs at Pratt & Whitney. “The F135 has more than 600,000 flight hours. Safety for the warfighter is and will continue to be our number one priority.”\\nVideo of that incident at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth showed the newly constructed F-35B hovering close to the ground before descending. The fighter bounced once and tipped forward; its nose and wing touched the ground as it started to spin around. The fighter’s Air Force pilot, who was performing a quality check flight for the Defense Contract Management Agency, safely ejected on the ground.\\nAfter that accident, Lockheed Martin, which makes the jet, halted acceptance flights of new F-35s at all three of its production facilities, including Air Force Plant 4 in Fort Worth.\\nThis had the effect of also halting deliveries for the last two weeks of the year, which meant Lockheed delivered 141 F-35s in 2022, fewer than the contractually required 148.\\nLockheed told Defense News on Dec. 30 it was on track to meet its delivery commitments before the mishap, and has continued to build F-35s. The company said it had nine completed fighters ready to undergo acceptance flights.\\nThe JPO said in a statement last week to Defense News it had issued guidance restricting some higher-risk aircraft from flight operations while the investigation continued. The JPO later revised its statement to say it had recommended the flight operation restrictions until procedures are developed for their return to flight.\\nDefense News also learned last week the initial investigation into the Dec. 15 mishap, conducted by Naval Air Systems Command with JPO’s support, found a tube used to transfer high-pressure fuel in the fighter’s engine had failed. This discovery prompted the JPO to update its safety risk assessments for a small number of fighters.\\nThe JPO said it is working with DCMA, Pratt & Whitney, and Lockheed Martin to develop procedures to lift the restrictions and resume acceptance flight operations, but doesn’t know how long the groundings will be in effect.\\nWASHINGTON — The Army has wrapped up an industry demonstration of a variety of possible Electric Light Reconnaissance Vehicles (eLRV), but the future of the program remains uncertain due to the absence of funding.\\nThe Maneuver Capabilities Development and Integration Directorate’s (MCDID) Maneuver Requirements Division (MRD) in conjunction with the Army’s product lead for Ground Mobility Vehicles (PL GMV) held a demonstration event for industry with electric vehicles that could perform the reconnaissance mission at Fort Benning, Georgia, last week, according to a May 21 service statement.\\nTen vendors brought electric vehicles so the Army could test the off-road capability, define goals and inform possible solutions with feedback from soldiers who would operate such vehicles, the statement noted.\\nThe Army analyzed two pure electric demonstrators and several internal combustion engine demonstrators “that exhibit current military integrated cab structures and architectures for potential eLRV program pursuit,” MCDID told Defense News in a separate statement.\\nThe Army will take the feedback to inform what could be a future prototyping program. The service will take data collected from the demonstration and elsewhere to help define characteristics and a prepare a draft request for prototype proposals the service anticipates releasing this summer, the May 21 statement added.\\nThe Army’s requirements leaders would like to better understand how recharging such systems would work on the battlefield and in austere conditions.\\nGeneral Motors Defense said earlier this month it had provided one of its Infantry Squad Vehicles outfitted with electric power to the demonstration and Polaris is said to have included a vehicle for the demonstration as well.\\nThe Army decided to look into a possible program due to the need for a light reconnaissance vehicle for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams. The motivation for an all-electric vehicle is rooted in the benefits electric capability brings both tactically and operationally including increased duration.\\n“Through nontraditional powertrain electrification, the eLRV would provide enhanced mobility, automotive performance, on-demand silent operation, lethality, protection, mission load capacity, and onboard power for a six-Soldier Scout Squad with their associated equipment to conduct combinations of mounted and dismounted Reconnaissance and Surveillance (R&S) missions for the IBCT for extended durations without the need for resupply,” leaders from the MCDID told Defense News.\\nThe Army, according to officials, sees the new vehicles as the “perfect platform” to serve as the first electrified ground vehicle in the Army fleet. A prototype could inform how to electrify multiple platforms across the fleet.\\nWhile the vehicle is a possible prototype “for a fully electric, range extended electric or hybrid-electric tactical vehicle,” Army officials told Defense News, there is no funding for such a program yet.\\nShould funding become available for the program, the Army plans to pursue a similar effort as it did to procure its infantry squad vehicle.\\nThe Army approved on May 3 an Abbreviated Capabilities Development Document for potential prototypes with baseline achievable requirements to include range also called silent mobility, duration on station also called silent watch, and exportable power.\\nShould the program receive funding, the PL GMV office would launch a prototyping effort with the first phase set to begin in fiscal 2022. This would consist of commercial off-the-shelf or non-developmental vehicles to be provided to an operational infantry brigade combat team unit to test. The Army would share costs with industry during this phase, the service said.\\nThe Army would choose up to four contractors providing two prototypes each.\\nContractors that pass through a critical design review-type event will move on to the second phase in FY23.\\n“It is expected that the second phase vehicles would be fully integrated and should accurately represent the eLRV in an operational environment,” the statement noted.\\nFollowing the effort, the Army would determine its final requirements approved at the Army Requirements Oversight Council level and decide on an acquisition strategy.\\nLONDON — The Royal Navy has ordered what it says will be the largest and most complex unmanned submarine operated by a European navy in a deal aimed at strengthening Britain’s ability to protect undersea cables and pipelines.\\nThe contract, secured by M Subs, a small specialist underwater vehicles maker based in Plymouth, South West England, should see the 12-meters-long submarine delivered to the Royal Navy in two years.\\nAnnouncing the £15.4 million ($18.9 million) deal Dec. 1 the Ministry of Defence said the procurement is the “first step in developing an operational autonomous submarine that will work side-by-side with crewed submarines – including the Astute-class hunter-killers and their successors – or independently.”\\nKnown as Project Cetus, the vehicle, named after a mythological sea monster, is the latest in a growing list of investments by the British aimed at strengthening its ability to protect key underwater infrastructure from potential sabotage – a threat heightened by the recent attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea.\\nLast month the MoD revealed it was holding a competition, valued at around £20 million, to supply the Royal Fleet Auxiliary , the Navy’s support arm, with a remotely operated deep water salvage capability.\\nNews of that development came just days after Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced that leaders plan to accelerate the delivery of the first of two multirole ocean surveillance ships ordered by the British to protect underwater cables.\\nThe first of the ships is expected to be handed over in the next few weeks, well ahead of the original delivery date.\\nIn a statement announcing the unmanned submarine deal Wallace said that in order to meet the “growing threats to our underwater infrastructure, the Royal Navy needs to be ahead of the competition with cutting-edge capabilities. Project Cetus, alongside bringing forward the MROS ships, will help ensure we have the right equipment to protect the security of the UK and our allies.”\\nThe bespoke unmanned vessel ordered by the British is the length of a London double decker bus, has a diameter of 2.2 meters and weighs 17 tons.\\nThe British have already put money into a dedicated tech trials ship, and the MoD said Cetus is considered the “equivalent for sub-sea experimentation.”\\nThe battery-powered vessel will be able to cover up to 1,000 miles in a single mission, though the range could be increased with the installation of additional batteries, said the MoD.\\nOther enhancements to the modular-built vessel could include an optional section that can be added to double its capacity.\\nUp to now the Navy has experimented with, and some imes operated, autonomous underwater systems in places like Scotland, where Britain bases its nuclear submarine flee.\\nMost, though, are small, off-the-shelf systems largely used in mine hunting.\\nFirst Sea Lord Adm. Sir Ben Key said the deal was a hugely exciting moment and in a different league to unmanned underwater vehicles purchased to date by the British.\\n“This extra large autonomous underwater vehicle is a capability step-change in our mission to dominate the underwater battle space, he said.”\\nUPDATE — This story has been updated to correct the location for ISV production in North Carolina. A GM Defense representative previously misspoke.\\nWASHINGTON — GM Defense delivered its first Infantry Squad Vehicle to the U.S. Army in an Oct. 27 ceremony at its proving grounds and production facility in Milford, Michigan, just 120 days after being chosen to build the new troop carrier.\\nThe Army awarded the company a $214.3 million contract to produce 649 vehicles by the end of fiscal 2024. The service is planning to procure a total of 2,065 ISVs.\\nDesigned to carry a nine-soldier squad, the ISV was specifically put together to be light enough to be sling loaded from a UH-60 Black Hawk and small enough to fit inside a CH-47 Chinook, to provide maximum flexibility for deployment.\\nGM’s design is based off the company’s 2020 Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 midsize truck and uses 90 percent commercial parts including a 186-horsepower, 2.8L Duramax turbo-diesel engine and performance race components. It also features a custom rollover protection system.\\nWhile the first low-rate initial production vehicles — 27 in total — will be built in Michigan, GM has a long-term plan to move its ISV manufacturing to Concord, North Carolina, where it is standing up a facility to manage its higher volume ISV production.\\nThe Army first identified a need for a light infantry vehicle in 2015 when its most recent combat vehicle strategy was released, but nothing materialized until Congress forced the Army to launch the competition as part of the FY18 National Defense Authorization Act. The Army awarded $1 million contracts to three teams in August 2019 to develop offerings — GM Defense, a team of Oshkosh Defense and Flyer Defense LLC and an SAIC and Polaris team.\\n“One hundred and twenty days from contract award to delivery is a significant milestone, and I am very proud of the team for this accomplishment,” David Albritton, president of GM Defense, said in a statement. “We’re leveraging General Motors\\' engineering prowess and immense manufacturing capabilities to bring transformative solutions to the military vehicle market. Our initial success with the ISV shows our commitment to our customer and highlights our unique right to win in the military mobility market.”\\nGM Defense has a “very, very talented team,\" Albritton said during the ceremony, and “their innovation, attention to detail, flexibility when incorporating soldier feedback during testing and a magnitude of other factors helped us to win this ISV contract and gives me great hope for how we will tackle other pursuits in the future.”\\nThe first vehicles will be going to the 1st Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne Division, but ultimately 11 IBCTs will be outfitted with 59 vehicles each under the first contract covering the 649 ISVs.\\nThe vehicles are slated to go through tests in the coming year, including further analysis of its air-deployable capability, as well as verification the maintenance manuals are complete. The first unit equipped will take the ISV through an initial operational test and evaluation.\\nWith the success of the ISV, GM Defense is setting its sights on other opportunities with the Army and other military services.\\n“We have a strong interest in the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle Program,” Albritton said. The Army is planning to re-compete for the JLTV and for new Humvees to round out the tactical vehicle fleet.\\n“If you look at the size and scale of this program, obviously, this is closer to a commercial-size vehicle, but as you step up in class and step up in weight, we believe we have a right to win in vehicles sizes of that size,” he added.\\n“That doesn’t limit us there, as well. There are only a few ground vehicle programs across the [Defense Department] right now, but we believe that other than doing a fully integrated vehicle like we do on ISV or what we potentially could do on JLTV in partnership with other companies, we can look at programs like the Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle for the U.S. Marine Corps, or we can look at the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle,\" Albritton said. “But if you think about power and propulsion solutions, you think about light weighting, think about cybersecurity, there’s other types of capabilities that we can apply in partnership on a variety of platforms as well.”\\nGM spent several recent years helping the Army evaluate a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle using a ZH2 Chevy Colorado and the Army is now taking some renewed steps at getting after an electric vehicles in its fleet to include the pursuit of an electric light reconnaissance vehicle.\\nPARIS — Any potential transfers of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine – whether from the United States or from an allied operator – would take months to complete, a State Department official said here June 19.\\nWhile the U.S. has not itself announced any transfers of F-16 fighter aircraft to Ukraine to date, it supports other allies’ intent to deliver those aircraft to Kyiv, said Stan Brown, the department’s principal deputy assistant secretary for the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs.\\nReports began swirling in May that the Netherlands was considering giving a portion of its F-16 fleet to Ukraine, and wanted to begin training pilots as soon as possible. But the transfer of such aircraft to Ukraine has to be a “holistic” approach, to include training both pilots and maintainers, Brown told reporters Monday at the biennial Paris Air Show outside the city. One of the first steps in a potential transfer of F-16 aircraft will be the license to train those airmen, before the license to transfer the aircraft even occurs.\\nThen, the aircraft themselves need to be identified – whether they’ll be delivered via a third-party transfer or another mechanism – before developing a plan for the Ukrainian military to use the aircraft, Brown continued.\\nThe State Department is already working to complete the paperwork for third-party transfer requests coming from nations like the Netherlands so that pilot training can begin, he said. But he declined to provide a specific timeline for that completion.\\nThe shadow of Russia’s war in Ukraine has prompted an overhaul of the State Department’s foreign military sales processes to both ensure Ukraine is receiving the military aid it needs quickly and efficiently and to streamline sales processes for other U.S. allies.\\nLast month, the department released a “retooling” document for FMS sales, detailing a 10-point plan to streamline the process and improve efficiency in providing capabilities to allies. The points include strategic goals such as developing regional approaches to arms transfers and promoting FMS cases based on the goals described in the National Security Strategy. But they also acknowledge a need to improve security cooperation officer training and modernize the notification process to Congress to avoid duplication of efforts while ensuring transparency.\\nThe U.S. government has provided about $40 billion in military aid to Ukraine to date and “used pretty much every tool in our security cooperation toolkit to get things done,” Brown told reporters on the show floor here. That aid has come in many forms: presidential drawdown authorities, direct transfers from Defense Department stocks, excess defense articles, third-party transfers and direct commercial sale re-exports, as well as foreign military sales and grant assistance, and licensed direct commercial sales, he noted.\\n“The bottom line [is] that the scale of what we’re doing there is historic,” Brown said. “Things that used to take months and weeks to get through the approval process across the interagency [are] happening in a manner of hours.”\\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has also prompted the State Department to prioritize transitioning nations away from Soviet-made equipment, Brown said.\\nMultiple European nations have donated their aging Russian capabilities to Ukraine over the past year and a half. The Czech Republic, Greece, and Slovenia have sent over T-72 tanks, BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles and a slew of armored personnel carriers, with commitments from NATO member nations to replace that equipment with more modern, interoperable vehicles.\\nThe State Department’s goal now is to help incentivize such nations to continue donating equipment to Ukraine that will be useful in Kyiv’s defense against Russia, as well as help to transition those countries away from Soviet-era systems in the future.\\n“We look first to make sure countries can help backfill Ukraine … and then we try to backfill them,” he added.\\nWASHINGTON — The bids are in for a chance to build prototypes for the Army’s Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle that will replace its Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle.\\nAmong them is a Raytheon and Rheinmetall team putting forward Rheinmetall’s Lynx 41 Infantry Fighting Vehicle, and General Dynamics Land Systems, which showcased its Griffin III technology demonstrator equipped with a 50mm cannon a year ago at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual exposition.\\nIt is currently unknown if any other teams submitted bids by the service’s set deadline of Oct. 1. None have come forward publicly despite rumors of a dark horse or two.\\nAbsent from the usual brood of combat vehicle manufacturers is BAE Systems. Defense News broke the news earlier this year that the company wouldn’t compete in the OMFV competition.\\nTextron has joined the Raytheon and Rheinmetall team with plans to, if chosen to build the new vehicle, build Lynx here in the United States at its Slidell, Louisiana, manufacturing facility. Raytheon and Rheinmetall announced a joint venture Oct. 1 — calling it Raytheon Rheinmetall Land Systems LLC — to pursue the OMFV competition.\\n“General Dynamics Land Systems submitted our OMFV proposal and bid sample to the US Army on 27 September. GD’s bid sample was purpose built to address the desired system lethality, survivability and mobility as substantiation of our response to the Army’s request for proposal,” the company said in a statement sent to Defense News. The company did not provide details on the submission.\\nGDLS did note, however, that it is proposing a “purpose built vehicle” using technologies from other platforms and “years of investment in advanced capabilities to include a 50mm cannon,” according to the statement.\\nThe Army released its request for proposals in March opening a competition to build prototypes. The service plans to choose from the pool of bidders up to two teams to build 14 prototypes each.\\nThe service will choose a winner that will start replacing Bradleys in 2026 that is designed to better operate in future environments that would allow soldiers to maneuver to a position of advantage and “to engage in close combat and deliver decisive lethality during the execution of the combined arms maneuver,” according to an Army statement issued along with the RFP release.\\nSome of the threshold requirements for OMFV are a 30mm cannon and a second-generation, forward-looking infrared system, or FLIR. Objective requirements are a 50mm cannon and a third-generation FLIR.\\nBrig. Gen. Ross Coffman, who is in charge of Next-Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) modernization efforts, said at the Defense News Conference in September that he is confident the requirements set for OMFV are right and had no plans to change them.\\nThe selected prototypes will go through “rigorous” operational testing and soldier assessments.\\nThe Army plans to downselect to one vehicle for low-rate initial production following the assessments and testing.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Army is putting the finishing touches on its request for proposals to industry to officially open a competition worth up to $12 billion to build more Joint Light Tactical Vehicles.\\nThe contest could unseat incumbent Oshkosh Defense, which won the initial JLTV contract in 2015. The Army always planned to conduct a follow-on competition as it reached the end of the initial contract. To prepare, the service incentivized companies participating in the first competition to provide as much technical data as possible.\\nWisconsin-based Oshkosh has built about 10,000 vehicles and is under contract to build more than 66,000. The contract is expected to amount to roughly $30 billion by 2024.\\nThe Army conducted initial market research once the JLTV was approved for full-rate production in 2019. This followed a delay of almost six months related to a series of alterations made to the vehicle in response to soldier feedback.\\nThe service then made the decision to move forward with a new competition, holding its first industry day in February 2020, Mike Sprang, the JLTV Joint Program Office’s program manager, told Defense News in an interview ahead of the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference.\\nSince then, the office has conducted multiple industry days, released several draft RFPs, updated section elements and answered 400 questions from industry.\\n“We have an incumbent who’s already built over 10,000 vehicles,” Sprang said. “Any time we anticipate having an effective competition, you have to make industry part of the process to understand what do they need to make business decisions.”\\nAnother update to the draft RFP is expected in October, he noted.\\nThe Army plans to release the RFP in January 2022 and award a contract to one team in September 2022, he said. At one point the Army had considered awarding contracts to two teams, but the service determined “there just wasn’t funding support for dual sources,” he added.\\nWith technology advancing and becoming cheaper since the JLTV was first designed, the Army hopes to add several new capabilities to the vehicles. Corrosion protection, for instance, is very important, Sprang said, especially for the Marine Corps. The goal is to move from a 20-year protection level to a 30-year level.\\nFor the Army, which uses the vehicles for training and frequently moves them around, improved fuel efficiency is a desired attribute in a new version of the vehicle, Sprang noted. The service set forth in its draft RFP a fuel efficiency improvement goal of 5 percent, and asked for an anti-idle capability.\\n“Looking at it, we believe that we can actually save on average 15 to 20 percent fuel consumption yearly,” Sprang said.\\nThe Army also plans to include lithium-ion batteries in the base capability of the new JLTV. “We’re saying use that architecture to not have to turn on your engine when you first need radios, when you first need HVAC [heating and cooling], and when the battery is drained to a certain point the engine turns on, charges, then shuts off again,” he said.\\nThe Army wants a next-generation vehicle architecture that can accommodate the power needed for an increase in capability. The service plans to offer incentives to the manufacturer depending on when it’s provided.\\n“If they provide it within two years, we’ll pay for it, it will be a part of the contract,” Sprang said, but if the manufacturer brings it in on Day One, the Army will issue incentives.\\nThe new JLTV will also incorporate some “driver-centric” technologies, Sprang said, like 360-degree awareness with multiple cameras around the vehicle, blind-spot monitoring, better backup cameras and hill-decline capability.\\nOther capabilities the program office would like to consider are tactile response features, like a seat that vibrates if the vehicle is getting too close to something or is in a dangerous location, rather than relying on an alarm or a display warning.\\nTen years ago, some of these capabilities wouldn’t have worked for a military vehicle, but the commercial industry has driven the price down through its own development efforts, “and now is a good time to look at applications in military vehicles,” Sprang said.\\n“JLTV is a fantastic platform to get that capability,” he added. “We don’t necessarily require all of it. It’s up to every vendor to decide which ones they’re going to propose as they do their own best-value calculation.”\\nSprang said the number of industry engagements as well as the number of companies who have leased current JLTVs to assess them means the program office expects a robust competition.\\nNavistar, AM General and GM Defense have publicly said they are considering competing for the contract.\\nOnce an award is made, the winner will have 12 months after signing to start delivering vehicles to the Army, Sprang said.\\nPARIS — The trinational program meant to build a new fighter jet for Europe, along with an array of next-generation systems and weapons, has gained a new partner – to a degree.\\nBelgium has officially joined the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program as an observer, the French Ministry of Defense announced June 20. Bringing Brussels onto the team in this capacity will not change the current contracts signed between France, Germany, and Spain, officials said, but rather will allow stakeholders to “imagine” how Belgian industry might eventually contribute to the FCAS program sometime in the future.\\nIt will also accelerate the operational partnership between the four nations’ air forces, the French Armed Forces said in a Tuesday release.\\n“We are convinced that this collaboration will be fruitful, and will serve the interests of European defense in the context of profound shifts in technology and international security,” the ministry said.\\nDefense News reported June 16 that Brussels was mulling joining the trinational program, which would result in a slew of next-generation aerospace technologies delivered to the participating nations around 2040, centered around a sixth-generation fighter jet that would eventually replace the participants fleets of Eurofighter Typhoons and Dassault Rafales.\\nAnother benefit of bringing Brussels into the fold would be to develop closer cooperation between the Belgian defense industrial base and the current FCAS suppliers, per the French ministry. Dassault Aviation, Airbus Defense and Space, and Indra Sistemas are the three prime contractors on the program, representing France, Germany, and Spain, respectively.\\nThe role of observer status is one that’s common during the research-and-development phases of programs, Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus’ executive vice president for military air systems, told reporters on Tuesday.\\nThe distinction of observer means the nation and its industry are not part of the decision-making team for the program, but that “you can know enough of [the program] to prepare a further collaboration” with the current partners, he said at a briefing during the biennial Paris Air Show, held outside of the city.\\nWhat does Belgium’s entry mean for the stakeholders at this point in time? “I would say, a bit early to say,” Dumont noted. “I think we’re going to write the history as we move.”\\nHe emphasized that the contracts for the recently launched Phase 1B of the FCAS program, as well as the future Phase 2, have already been signed with the three current partner nations. “So, we are going to execute this contract with three nations.”\\nAny potential increased role for Belgium in the FCAS program will first need to be defined politically between Paris, Madrid, and Berlin, before an industry contract could be signed, he added.\\nFirst established in 2017 between France and Germany, the FCAS program seeks to develop a suite of leading-edge air capabilities by 2040. Spain joined the program in 2020.\\nIt includes seven technology pillars, to include the next-generation fighter – which will replace the participants’ fleets of Dassault Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft – a new engine for the fighter jet, a next-generation weapon system, new drones, advanced sensors and stealth technology, and an air combat cloud network.\\nAfter nearly two years of delays due to industry workshare disputes, the FCAS prime contractors signed an agreement in December 2022 to move ahead with Phase 1B, during which industry partners will spend the next two years finalizing the program’s architecture.\\nPhase 1B formally launched this past April, and is scheduled to run until 2025, French Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Stéphane Mille said in a June 8 interview with Defense News. Then, Phase 2 will focus on developing the fighter jet prototype, he said, with a demonstrator flight expected in 2029 – two years later than originally planned.\\nCOLOGNE, Germany — Rheinmetall is teaming with Textron Systems to pitch the Lynx KF41 vehicle as a Bradley replacement to the U.S. Army, the company announced Tuesday.\\nThe campaign marks the second time that the Düsseldorf, Germany-based company is targeting the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle program following an unsuccessful attempt last year that eventually saw the ground service halt the race.\\nThis time around, Rheinmetall is putting greater emphasis on a U.S. footprint, led by its growing American Rheinmetall Vehicles subsidiary based in Sterling Heights, Michigan. Textron, as the newcomer on Team Lynx, is meant to be front and center when it comes to manufacturing and robotics capabilities.\\n“Textron Systems\\' Slidell, Louisiana, vehicle production facility has supported more than 15 armored vehicle programs of record supporting over 20 countries,” Henry Finneral, senior vice president and general manager of Textron Systems\\' Marine and Land Systems business, said in a statement. “We stand ready to support the team and the US Army and deliver a trusted platform for the future.”\\nMatt Warnick, managing director at American Rheinmetall Vehicles, said the “teaming agreement brings together two of the world’s leading providers of defense industry solutions.\"\\nRaytheon remains part of the team.\\nExecutives hope the new Army competition will give all bidders more leeway in fine-tuning their eventual offers to the service’s requirements. That marks a contrast to the previous acquisition attempt, where the ground service essentially wanted specific features already built into prototype vehicles, with little time for companies to adjust.\\nThis time around, the Army plans to downsize to five bidders, then three, before picking an eventual winner. A final request for proposals is expected late this year or early next.\\nService officials have put competitors on notice that an open architecture in the vehicle design will be at a premium, a feature that Rheinmetall touted in its bid notice.\\n“The network is almost more important in some ways than building the combat vehicles,” Maj. Gen. Brian Cummings, program executive officer of ground combat systems, told Defense News in an interview ahead of the Association of the U.S. Army’s virtual conference, which ended last week.\\nRheinmetall previously planned to present the teaming arrangement with Textron at this year’s AUSA show if the event had taken place in person.\\nJen Judson in Washington contributed to this report.\\nWASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin may not be able to deliver as many F-35s as it had hoped this year due to delays involving the fighters’ upcoming Technology Refresh 3 upgrades.\\nHUNTSVILLE, Ala. — The U.S. Army is developing an extended-range cannon artillery system and will start building prototypes by the end of the year, according to the head of the services Long-Range Precision Fires modernization program. But beyond the first iteration, the service plans to add an autoloader starting in 2024, Col. John Rafferty explained.\\nThe Army plans to build 8 prototypes of the ERCA artillery system by 2023 with a culminating technology demonstration, Rafferty said. The service is focused on improvements to the platform, the projectile, the ammunition and propellant.\\nAfter years of planning, the Paladin Integrated Management program aims to upgrade the Paladin howitzer with an M109A7 chassis. From there, the ERCA program will upgrade PIM’s turret with a 58-caliber, 30-foot long gun tube capable of shooting farther than 70 kilometers.\\n“That is a major improvement,” Rafferty said, but “we still have a ways to go with integrating the precision guidance kit with a GPS fuze for that.”\\nThe challenge is the muzzle blasts are so much higher, he said, so it changes the way the fuze operates.\\nRafferty said the Army has shot an Excalibur round from the gun tube and hit a target at 62 kilometers.\\nThe first battalion will be fielded in fiscal 2023. The next increment beginning in 2024 will involve equipping the cannon with the autoloader.\\n“The autoloader is key to generating the volume of fire that really gives us that lethality at range,” Rafferty said, but it’s “a pretty complicated technology to develop.”\\nCurrently, the Army relies on two cannoneers to equip a dumb projectile with smart fuzes. This is being done in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, Rafferty noted.\\nAnd “there is a complex fuze-setting process and battery life on the fuzes, which means you can’t fuze them hours beforehand,” he explained. “You need to screw the fuzes on, then set them, and the charge lasts for a certain length of time.”\\nBut this process is challenging for autoloaders, he noted, which means the Army will have to take a unique approach.\\nWhile there is an internal effort to build an autoloader prototype, the service is also looking to the Army Applications Lab at Army Futures Command in Austin, Texas, for ideas that might approach the challenge differently, Rafferty said.\\nThe lab is located in an innovator’s hub called the Capital Factory and is geared toward uniting Army requirements writers and developers with individuals and companies with nontraditional technology that could be applied to efforts underway within the service.\\nSTUTTGART, Germany – Autonomous and remotely operated drones are at the heart of France’s ambitions to further explore and exploit the deep sea waters under a new seabed strategy release Monday.\\nThe goal of the new strategy is to equip the French military with the ability to reach depths of 6,000 meters, or nearly 20,000 feet, said Minister of Defense Florence Parly in a press conference. “This makes it possible to cover 97 percent of the seabed and effectively protect our interests, including sub-marine cables,” she said.\\nThe French Ministry of Defense will partner with its procurement arm, the Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA) and industry partners to develop new autonomous unmanned vehicles (AUVs) and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), said Gen. Thierry Burkhard, chief of the Defense Staff, during the briefing.\\nBy 2023, the military should have developed one AUV and one ROV to serve as initial surveillance assets and be used for testing and assessment purposes. A larger program is expected to be launched by 2025, Burkhard said.\\nTwo existing programs will also contribute to Paris’ seabed strategy, including the future anti-mine warfare system known by its acronym SLAM-F, which aims to replace Navy divers with robots built by Thales and its partners Saab, ECV and ASV, by 2024. The British navy is also involved in the SLAM-F project, under the Franco-British Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) program.\\nAnother program already underway, “CHOF” (capacité hydrographique et océanographique future), aims to replace France’s three hydrographic vessels with newer ships that can more accurately monitor the seabed and underwater activities, Burkhard said.\\nThe French military has adopted strategies in the past couple of years related to cyber and space security, and Parly sees the seabed strategy as a natural progression. The three relatively nascent “domains” are all ripe for competition, thanks to advances in unmanned technologies, she noted.\\n“Today, the emergence of drones and remotely operated robots – driven by the needs of industry [and] capable of carrying out operations that meet military objectives at a depth of several thousand meters – are transforming the seabed into a new space for strategic competition,” Parly said. The sheer immensity and opacity of the deep sea domain will make it difficult to characterize and attribute any actions that take place down below.\\nBut Paris must be able to react to any such actions, and be capable of protecting the critical seabed infrastructure like the fiberoptic cables that carry 99 percent of the world’s digital data, she emphasized.\\nMastering the seabed will also help protect military and industrial secrets, Parly said. She cited the recent crashes of a U.S. F-35 joint strike fighter in the South China Sea, and a British F-35 in the Mediterranean Sea, as proof “that the ability to search and recover a sensitive object from very great depths is not only a technical issue, but also a strategic one.”\\nFrance is well incentivized to “master” the sea bed. The nation has the largest exclusive economic zone in the world, owing to its many territories still spread across the world – from islands like Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Atlantic, to French Guiana on the coast of South America, to Tahiti and the rest of French Polynesia in the Pacific, to mainland France itself in Europe.\\nThe seabed strategy is consistent with France’s 2030 investment plan, Parly noted. The Ministry of Defense will be supported by the nation’s recently reformed Ministry of the Sea, which has developed a strategy for the exploration and exploitation of mineral resources on the deep sea bed. Government officials have earmarked 650 million euros (U.S. $734 million) out of a COVID-19 economic recovery plan into the maritime sector.\\nOther nations have taken note of the seabed’s potential. China is leading the race to mine the deep seas for rare Earth minerals and crucial battery metals. Beijing holds five deep sea mining contracts, the most of any country.\\nMeanwhile, the United Kingdom highlighted the need to focus on undersea warfare in its 2021 Defense Command paper, albeit briefly. In it, the Ministry of Defence warned of Russia’s investment in “significant underwater capabilities, including deep-sea capabilities which can threaten undersea cables, as well as a torpedo capable of delivering a nuclear payload to coastal targets.”\\nThe UK also declared its commitment to develop a new multi-role ocean surveillance ship over the next three years, equipped with remotely-operated and autonomous undersea drones to be used for data and information collection.\\nPARIS — Elta Systems, a subsidiary of Israel Aerospace Industries, has teamed up with German sonar manufacturer Atlas Elektronik to develop an anti-submarine warfare system, a sector in which the company wants to grow its footprint.\\nWhile the majority of defense companies present at the Paris Air Show here are focused on furthering their aerospace ventures, the Israeli radar specialist has also been eyeing an expansion in the underwater market.\\nThe firm announced its new partnership with Atlas, a subsidiary of Germany’s Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, aimed at launching a joint product, the BlueWhale anti-submarine warfare (ASW) variant. The system is based on Elta’s autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), integrated with Atlas’ towed passive sonar triple array.\\n“The unique feature of this addition is that it allows the system to operate at depths generally used by submarines to avoid being detected by using a low-frequency sonar,” Yoav Tourgeman, chief executive officer of Elta Systems, told Defense News on the sidelines of the air show here.\\nHe added that the widening set of possible applications for autonomous underwater systems, commercial or military, is part of what is driving the company to further explore their potential.\\nThe BlueWhale ASW package features an advanced transmitter that allows for the bistatic detection and tracking of submarine targets.\\nTourgeman confirmed to Defense News that the company was in talks with several customers interested in the system, but would not confirm whether one of those was Germany.\\nWhile the BlueWhale ASW could be of interest for the German Navy, some naval experts have expressed doubts regarding whether the country would be the launch customer based on current financial constraints.\\n“From a general standpoint, it would be interesting for them, especially based on the recently published German Navy objectives for 2035 and beyond, which places a strong emphasis on uncrewed systems in the underwater domain as a way to match increasing operational demands with scarce human resources,” Johannes Peters, head of the Center for Maritime Strategy and Security at the Institute for Security Policy at Kiel University, said.\\nHowever, he notes the multitude of large projects the country has ongoing in the naval sector, including the development of the new F-126 frigate, the U212-CD submarines and purchasing P-8 maritime patrol aircraft from Boeing.\\n“Given this backdrop, there is simply no budget for a short or medium term procurement – it is highly unlikely that the proclaimed first customer would be Germany,” Peters opined.\\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday he hopes that training for Ukrainian pilots on American-made F-16 fighter jets will begin in the coming weeks, bolstering Ukraine in the long run but not necessarily as part of an anticipated spring counteroffensive against Russia.\\nAustin spoke as defense leaders from around the world assembled for a virtual meeting to discuss the ongoing military support for Ukraine. They were expected talk about which countries will provide F-16s, and how and where the pilot training will be done.\\nThe officials will also get an update on the war effort from Ukrainian leaders, including preparation for that anticipated counteroffensive and how the allies, who have faced their own stockpile pressures, can continue to support Kyiv’s fight against Russia.\\n“We’re going to have to dig deeper, and we’re going to have to continue to look for creative ways to boost our industrial capability,” Austin said before the military leaders began their closed session. “The stakes are high. But the cause is just and our will is strong.”\\nEuropean countries have said they are talking about which countries may have some of the F-16s available. The United States had long balked at providing the advanced aircraft to Ukraine, and only last weekend did President Joe Biden agree to allow other nations to send their own U.S.-made jets to Kyiv.\\n“We hope this training will begin in the coming weeks,” Austin said. “This will further strengthen and improve the capabilities of the Ukrainian Air Force in the long term. And it will complement our short-term and medium-term security agreements. This new joint effort sends a powerful message about our unity and our long-term commitment to Ukraine’s self-defense.”\\nThe leaders will also likely discuss Ukraine’s other continuing military needs, including air defense systems and munitions, artillery and other ammunition.\\nIt was not immediately clear whether they will make any firm decisions on the F-16 issue, but initial steps have begun.\\nJosep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said Tuesday that training for Ukrainian pilots had begun in Poland and some other countries, though Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said training was still in the planning phase. The Netherlands and Denmark, among others, are also making plans for training.\\n“We can continue and also finalize the plans that we’re making with Denmark and other allies to start these these trainings. And of course, that is the first step that you have to take,” Dutch Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren said, adding that initial discussions about who may have F-16s available to send is underway.\\nUkraine has long sought the sophisticated fighter to give it a combat edge as it battles Russia’s invasion, now in its second year.\\nThe Biden administration’s decision was a sharp reversal after refusing to approve any transfer of the aircraft or conduct training for more than a year because of worries that doing so could escalate tensions with Russia. U.S. officials also had argued against the F-16 by saying that learning to fly and logistically support such an advanced aircraft would be difficult and take months.\\nAir Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said this week that the U.S. decision on the F-16 was part of a broader long-term commitment to meet Ukraine’s future military needs. He said the jets would not be relevant in any counteroffensive expected to begin shortly.\\nAt the end of the demonstration period in 2017, the hope is to have an idea whether the technology is \"really worth pursuing,\" Butrico said. \"Obviously from what we know now we think it probably is worth pursuing, but again, we are not the end users so we really want our customer to tell us how to shape future efforts and, the technology, where it goes.\"\\nIf all goes well, the next step might be to incorporate the technology into a military vehicle like a Humvee. GM and TARDEC opted to demonstrate the technology using a commercial vehicle first because of the much shorter build timeline.\\nBut applications for vehicles like Abrams tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles that use a lot of fuel in idle mode to power on-board equipment hold a lot of promise.\\nThe Army will take the keys from GM on April 10, and then a wide range of soldiers, even potentially other services, will put the ZH2 to the test.\\nThe demonstrator will first go to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida for special forces units to try.\\nFrom there, the vehicle will be transported at the end of June to Fort Carson, Colorado, where it will be tested by a wide variety of units from Stryker brigades to armored, light infantry and more special forces. The environment will give the Army a chance to test the technology at high-altitude and rockier terrain, Butrico said.\\nAt the end of August, the ZH2 will be passed to soldiers at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and then it will be moved to Fort Benning, Georgia, in early September, Butrico said.\\nAlso in September, the ZH2 will make an appearance at Modern Day Marine and will take a turn on the Severe Off-Road Track at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia.\\nWhile not yet locked in, according to Butrico, the ZH2 might also undergo evaluations with the Marine Corps and Naval Special Warfare Command as well as the Army’s 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii. Those would likely happen at some point between October and April, he said.\\nThe technology being tested in the vehicle now could expand far beyond such a platform in the future. Butrico said the tech is being incorporated into an unmanned undersea vessel and that there is a hydrogen-powered unmanned aircraft currently in the lab at TARDEC. The technology could also be used for stationary power supply at bases that currently consume a large amount of fuel.\\nThe demonstrations also stand to address some of the misinformation or presumptions about hydrogen fuel cell technology that may have stunted its progression into the mainstream in the past.\\n\"The biggest question that we always get is safety,\" Butrico said. \"Hydrogen explodes,\" but if it’s pure hydrogen, a lighted match would go out, he added. \"Pure hydrogen will not ignite. You have to have a pretty optimal combination of hydrogen, oxygen and emission source so that if that ratio is too much hydrogen or not enough hydrogen, it won’t combust.\"\\nAlso, a puncture in a liquid fuel tank would leak on the ground close to a vehicle, but hydrogen escapes straight up at 45 miles per hour, Butrico noted.\\n\"There are questions we haven’t even thought of that soldiers are going to come up with,\" Butrico said. \"We really look forward to that and having them hit us with things that we didn’t expect so we can think about that, consider it and plan for it in the follow-on phase, and not just with this vehicle, but any other vehicle as well.\"\\nWASHINGTON — The Air Force is focused on avoiding the mistakes that plagued past programs like the F-35, as the service officially kicks off its effort to build a sixth-generation fighter, Secretary Frank Kendall said Monday.\\nThat includes ensuring the Air Force has access to all the sustainment data it needs from the contractor building the Next Generation Air Dominance platform, Kendall told reporters at a breakfast roundtable hosted by the Defense Writers Group.\\n“We’re not going to repeat the, what I think frankly was a serious mistake that was made in the F-35 program” of not obtaining rights to all the fighter’s sustainment data from contractor Lockheed Martin, Kendall said.\\nWhen the F-35 program was launched more than two decades ago, Kendall said an acquisition philosophy known as Total System Performance was in favor. Under this approach, he said, a contractor that won a program would own it for its entire lifecycle.\\n“What that basically does is create a perpetual monopoly,” Kendall said. “I spent years struggling to overcome acquisition malpractice [on the F-35], and we’re still struggling with that to some degree. So we’re not going to do that with NGAD.”\\nKendall also singled out excessive concurrency — which occurs when an aircraft moving through development and into procurement at the same time, which can make it harder to fix problems discovered in testing — as a major problem that hindered the F-35 program.\\nThere will be some concurrency on NGAD, as well as the B-21 Raider stealth bomber, Kendall said. But he said the Air Force plans to do that “in a rational way, that doesn’t take excessive risk.”\\nKendall said he wants the government to have much more control over NGAD than it does with the F-35. In addition to ensuring the government has access to the intellectual property it needs, Kendall said the Air Force will make sure NGAD’s manufacturer and subcontractors use modular open system design. That will allow the Air Force to bring in new and different suppliers as it seeks to upgrade parts of the system, he said.\\nThe Air Force’s program executive officer for fighters and advanced aircraft at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, who is now Brig. Gen. Dale White, will be in charge of the new program, Kendall said.\\nWith NGAD expected to be a very expensive proposition — Kendall told lawmakers in April 2022 he expected each aircraft to cost multiple hundreds of millions of dollars apiece — the Air Force won’t be able to afford working with multiple contractors on the program, Kendall said. The service plans to choose a single contractor to build NGAD sometime in 2024, with Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman expected to compete for the program.\\nKendall also said the acquisition strategy for collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) is moving forward in parallel with NGAD, and the Air Force is working with several potential suppliers to create autonomous drone wingmen associated with that concept. He said it’s too soon to say how many vendors the Air Force plans to work with, but that he wants “as many as possible.”\\nHe declined to describe how CCA capabilities might compare to crewed fighters, saying that information is classified.\\nKendall said NGAD’s origins date back to the Obama administration, when he in his previous role as the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics asked the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to study what the Air Force would need to ensure it could dominate the skies in a future war.\\nDARPA’s response, Kendall said, was that the service didn’t just need a lone fighter — it needed a “family of systems,” also encompassing weapons, connections to assets in space, and possibly autonomous drone wingmen.\\nKendall then launched a program called the Aerospace Innovation Initiative to start to develop technologies that would form the core of a sixth-generation fighter. That effort led to the creation of experimental prototype aircraft, which Kendall called X-planes, to flesh out those technologies and prove they can work.\\nAdvancements in model-based systems engineering and digitalization also made it possible for both government and contractor design teams to work together much more efficiently, he said.\\nThat’s what’s happening now with the offices developing NGAD, according to Kendall, with government designers and bidding companies essentially working side-by-side at Wright-Patterson. Government designers have direct access to the databases companies are using to design their pitches for NGAD, he explained.\\n“Everybody lives basically in the same design laboratory, if you will, so we have intimate knowledge of what the competitors are doing in their design,” Kendall said. “We’re very involved with them. … We’re going to have as integrated and as fully integrated a design process and contracting process as possible.”\\nThis is a more efficient approach than how acquisitions were run in the past, where the contractor would deliver “piles and piles of documents” to the government to sort through. “Now you don’t wait for documents, you can see the design firsthand,” Kendall said.\\nWASHINGTON — The Air Force announced Tuesday it will replace part of the E-3 Sentry, or Airborne Warning and Control System, fleet with Boeing E-7 Wedgetails.\\nIn a release, the service said the decision to go with the Wedgetail was based on market research and that it is “the only platform” that could meet all of the Defense Department’s requirements for tactical battle management, command and control, and target tracking in time to replace the aging E-3, which dates back to the 1970s.\\nThe Air Force plans to award a contract to Boeing in fiscal 2023 for the Wedgetail, which was developed by Australia for its air force.\\nThe service’s proposed 2023 budget calls for retiring 15 E-3s, or about half the fleet, from Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma. It would provide $227 million in research, development, test and evaluation funds for the replacement. The first rapid prototype E-7 would be delivered in fiscal 2027.\\nThe Air Force said it plans to fund a second rapid prototype aircraft in fiscal 2024 and aims to make a production decision the following year on fielding more Wedgetails.\\nThe release did not say how many Wedgetails the Air Force might eventually buy.\\nThe AWACS, a heavily modified Boeing 707 with a 30-foot rotating radar dome above its fuselage, provides command and control and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities to manage the battlefield, with a more than 250-mile range for its radar. It was flown in numerous conflicts in recent years, including Iraq and Afghanistan and has recently monitored the conflict in Ukraine.\\nBut the aircraft have an average age of more than 43 years, and the Air Force has repeatedly stressed the need to replace them as mission-capable rates declined and maintaining them became tougher and tougher.\\nThe Wedgetail has long been seen as the top contender for the job. Pacific Air Forces commander Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach told reporters last year he wanted the service to quickly buy the E-7 as an AWACS replacement.\\nAnd last month, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall told reporters the Wedgetail was “the leading candidate, quite obviously,” though he said more due diligence remained to be done.\\nWASHINGTON — Oshkosh Defense on Tuesday unveiled a silent drive hybrid electric version of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle it has fielded to the U.S. military and other customers.\\n“We developed the JLTV to offer our military customers an affordable way to electrify a light tactical wheeled vehicle fleet without compromising performance or protection,” John Bryant, Oshkosh’s president, said during a virtual briefing.\\nThe eJLTV offers “a few critical additions” over the JLTV: exportable power, improved fuel economy and technologies that enable silent drive and extended silent watch, “eliminating the noise and heat signatures associated with diesel engines,” Bryant said.\\nThe vehicle was developed using commercially available components and technology, he added.\\nOshkosh chose to focus on a hybrid vehicle rather than a fully electric version because it eliminates the need for charging stations, a real challenge for using the vehicle on the battlefield.\\nThe lithium ion battery charges while the diesel engine is in use, Bryant said. “It has the capacity of 30-kilowatt hours. The batteries, which are exceptionally durable, are designed to be used for a minimum of 10 years,” he added.\\nThe eJLTV also has increased export power up to 115 kilowatts, Bryant said, eliminating the need for towed generators.\\nTransitioning from silent mode to conventional mode happens through a “flip of a switch, and you can do this on the go,” Bryant said.\\nThe design also allows Oshkosh to turn existing JLTVs into hybrid electric versions.\\nUnder the current contract to deliver JLTVs to the military, the company has already built 15,000 of the vehicles and will ultimately build over 66,000 by 2024 for roughly $30 billion.\\n“Electrification of the ground vehicle fleet has become increasingly important to our military customers,” Bryant said. “Oshkosh Defense has been employing hybrid electric technology for the U.S. military on heavy- and medium-duty tactical wheeled vehicles for years, although adoption has mostly been in small quantities, demonstration and test programs.”\\nIn recent years, the U.S. Army and the other military services have been wading into the murky waters of fielding electric vehicles as industry comes forward with more options.\\nFor instance, in May 2021, the Army held a demonstration at Fort Benning, Georgia, where it evaluated electric vehicle options to help inform requirements for a possible future Electric Light Reconnaissance Vehicle, or eLRV.\\nGM Defense last year hosted Army officials in Michigan, allowing them to test drive an all-electric version of the service’s Infantry Squad Vehicle, and discussing how to best operate and manage an all-electric fleet.\\nBut when it comes to military vehicles, the services have tended to take the position that a hybrid electric version would likely be the more practical option, particularly for combat vehicles that require a lot of power.\\nThe Army has continued analysis and technology development of a next-generation powertrain for the JLTV that considers hybrid and full-electric options.\\nThe main reason Oshkosh developed the eJLTV “was because we listened to our customers,” Bryant said. “That message that we heard was that the military customer would want a hybrid electric technology and so we set out about a year and a half ago with concepts to develop that platform. We actually combined some of the requirements from a few different Army and Marine Corps science and technology programs.”\\nThe Army is preparing to hold a full and open competition for the next JLTV contract. The service is not requiring or offering incentives for a hybrid electric vehicle design at this time, but is including a desire for improved fuel efficiency and the incorporation of lithium ion batteries to run certain capabilities like radios while the engine is off.\\nThe Army plans to release a request for proposals early this year and award a contract to one team in September 2022. Navistar, GM Defense and AM General have all said they plan to compete.\\n“I believe the source selection criteria for the recompete [is] fairly well defined right now,” Bryant said. “I would be very surprised if the Army added a requirement for the eJLTV to the recompete itself. But, again, we’re ready. If the Army wanted to do that we’re ready to build them this vehicle right now.”\\nAURORA, Colorado — The Air Force is cutting in half the number of tankers it planned to buy as an interim step, as part of a move to rethink its overall aerial refueling modernization strategy, the service’s acquisition chief said Monday.\\nThe revamp of the Air Force’s strategy comes as the service is growing increasingly concerned about the likelihood it will face a dangerously contested airspace in a future war against an adversary like China. The approach is meant to ensure future tankers will be able to survive a war in which they are likely targeted.\\nAs part of this strategic shift, the Air Force will halve the number of tankers it originally planned to buy in the next decade from roughly 150 to about 75, Andrew Hunter told reporters in a roundtable at the Air and Space Forces Association’s AFA Warfare Symposium here.\\nHunter also said the requirements will be “more modest” than originally planned for the bridge tanker, which is the Air Force’s term for a planned tanker purchase meant to close a gap between buying its final Boeing-made KC-46 Pegasus and a next-generation tanker it originally referred to as KC-Z.\\nOriginally, the Air Force plotted a three-stage modernization effort, with its phases dubbed KC-X, KC-Y and KC-Z, to replace the legacy KC-135 Stratotanker fleet. The KC-46 Pegasus was acquired to fill the KC-X stage, and the Air Force was mulling its next steps for the KC-Y, or bridge tanker, which would tide the service over until it procured KC-Z sometime in the 2040s.\\nOver the last year, the Air Force has been conducting a business case analysis on the KC-Y to decide whether to hold a competition to choose between Lockheed Martin’s LMXT tanker and the KC-46, or to forgo the competition and buy more modified KC-46s from Boeing. If the Air Force ended up buying more KC-46s, Hunter said, it would likely get those tankers in 2032; if Lockheed won, Hunter expected their tankers would come in 2034.\\nThe Air Force originally thought its KC-Y requirements could be a tweaked version of the KC-X requirements, with additional capabilities, Hunter said.\\nBut after recent reviews and analyses of what the service’s refueling needs might be, he added, the service decided its current strategy for tanker modernization leaves the aircraft too vulnerable to attack.\\nHunter said the Air Force is now moving to a program called the next-generation aerial refueling system, or NGAS.\\nNGAS is “focused on ensuring that the tanker capabilities [in the] 2030s and beyond will be able to survive and operate in a much more contested environment than the tankers of the past, or the tankers that are in our current fleet,” he said.\\nHunter said recent Air Force studies, performed as part of Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall’s operational imperatives, underscored the threats potential adversaries might pose to vital aircraft such as tankers.\\n“We have to have an approach that allows us to address those threats and still refuel the joint force, and allow it to engage in all of the critical operations that are required for high intensity conflict,” he told reporters.\\nIn his keynote address at the conference Tuesday, Kendall said the Air Force must revise its approach to mobility aircraft, including tankers, to account for the threats of a future war.\\n“Our mobility fleet can no longer operate forward with relative impunity,” Kendall said. “The air threat is becoming much more severe, with increasing range. A particular concern is the survivability of our tankers, which will have to be farther forward to refuel fighters that operate within a few hundred miles of the threat.”\\nThis will require a new design for a more survivable tanker, Kendall said — “one that is not a derivative of a commercial aircraft.” He added that a blended wing body design is one option.\\nThe Air Force said in a January request for information for NGAS it planned to start conducting an analysis of alternatives for the program in October, and is soliciting ideas from the defense industry.\\nAccording to the RFI, the NGAS tanker must be able to operate in contested combat scenarios. The Air Force wanted ideas on how a tanker would refuel unmanned aerial systems, integrate with a joint air battle management network, and take off from or land at regional or improvised airfields.\\nHunter said the analysis of alternatives will take a “clean sheet” approach that could design an entirely new plane. He said the service wants a competitive pool of vendors — both aircraft companies and mission system providers — to plan the way ahead.\\nHunter noted the Air Force hopes to field the “initial increment” of NGAS in the mid- to late 2030s.\\nHe said that, based on the information industry has already sent the Air Force, the service could still end up selecting a modified KC-46 as its interim step. But if the Air Force does end up buying another wave of KC-46s, Hunter said the cost is likely to go up — partly because the KC-46 ended up being more expensive than anticipated, and partly because of the increased capabilities.\\nThe Air Force expects to contract for the last of 179 planned KC-46s in fiscal 2027, and receive them two years later, Hunter said, which would lead to a gap in tanker production under a KC-Y competition.\\nHunter said the Air Force expects to wrap up its business case analysis on the path forward on its future tanker needs by the middle of 2023.\\nHunter told Defense News on Tuesday he did not expect shifting strategies from KC-Y and Z to NGAS would lead to any significant losses.\\n“Anything we’ve done to date, we will be able to leverage going forward,” Hunter said.\\nCourtney Albon contributed to this report.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Army’s new Infantry Squad Vehicle is a cramped ride and offers limited protection from certain threats, according to a recent report from the Pentagon’s chief weapons tester, but it still meets the service’s requirements in tests and evaluations, the product lead told Defense News.\\nThe ISV “key requirements are being met and we are increasing soldier operational readiness by providing an operationally relevant vehicle that can transport small tactical units to a dismount point faster and in better physical and mental condition for the fight,” said Steven Herrick, the Army’s product lead for ground mobility vehicles within the Program Executive Office Combat Support and Combat Service Support.\\nThe vehicle was designed for easy transport to operational environments with the infantry’s current rotary and fixed-wing transport platforms. The key performance parameters required that the vehicle’s weight not exceed 5,000 pounds and that it fit inside a CH-47 Chinook cargo helicopter. Those requirements “force dimensional requirements only allowing the vehicle to be a certain height, width and length,” he said.\\nThe requirements led to a vehicle that makes it hard for soldiers with all their gear needed for a 72-hour mission to comfortably fit inside and be able to access rucksacks on the move.\\nThe Army assessed three vendors in developmental testing from December 2019 through January 2020. The service chose General Motors Defense to supply the vehicle to the force, with the company beating out an Oshkosh Defense and Flyer Defense team as well as an SAIC and Polaris team.\\nAll offerings were capable of carrying a nine-soldier infantry squad with weapons and equipment during movement, the director of operational test and evaluation said in the report. But the Pentagon also noted the ISV “has not demonstrated the capability to carry the required mission equipment, supplies and water for a unit to sustain itself to cover a range of 300 miles within a 72-hour period.”\\nThe Army, however, has assessed the ISV requirement and solution set is in alignment, Herrick said. The DOT&E report, he said, “indicates a desire to include more equipment than a standard nine-soldier squad would carry on a 72-hour mission.”\\nThis lack of space, the report stated, “may create a logistics and operational burden” and might limit the type of missions and duration for ISVs.\\nThe soldiers that participated in the touch point evaluating the vehicles were asked to bring their Advanced Combat Helmet and Improved Outer Tactical Vest with plates; individual weapon; night vision devices; and ruck with three days’ worth of supplies, Herrick said.\\n“All vendors’ ISVs are cramped and soldiers cannot reach, stow, and secure equipment as needed, degrading and slowing mission operations,” the report explained. During tests “soldiers on all ISVs could not readily access items in their rucksacks without stopping the movement, dismounting, and removing their rucksacks from the vehicle.”\\nThe soldier touch point took into account soldier comfort, visibility and ability to execute the mission, Herrick said. This was all factored into the Army’s decision to choose GM Defense’s vehicle.\\n“Additionally, no current or planned combat or tactical vehicle allows access to rucksacks while moving to support operator safety,” Herrick noted. “Crew spaces on the ISV are designed to allow mission performance of specific duty tasks.”\\nUnits also lacked reliable communication capability, according to the report, using hand-held or manpack radios between 62 and 300 miles. The ISV does not have a mounted radio requirement. “Communication between the squad leader, soldiers, and the platoon leader was intermittent and not reliable,” the report found.\\nBecause of the concept of the ISV providing an effective aid to insert soldiers into combat operations, the requirements support just what the soldier carries, so there is no mounted requirement yet, Herrick said. That requirement could be added as a growth capability later.\\nThe DOT&E report also noted that the ISV doesn’t have an underbody and ballistic survivability requirement, which could mean the unit would be susceptible to certain threats, but the ISV’s speed as well as its small, low profile might help deal with those issues. Adding protection to the vehicle would sacrifice the speed the squad needs to rapidly inject itself into operations.\\nOverall, GM Defense’s vehicle had the highest reliability among the three vendors, demonstrating 585 mean miles between operational mission failures. The Army’s user requirement is 1,200 mean miles for that situation.\\nHerrick noted that reliability and maintainability testing was not scheduled or conducted by Army Test and Evaluation Command or the program office, so the calculations used in the DOT&E report were “not supported by traditional [reliability and maintainability] RAM elements, such as scoring conferences and time for the vendor to implement changes.”\\nThe mileage accumulated and referenced in the report was “not meant to evaluate RAM by the Army, but rather to provide the program office and contractor an initial insight on the capability of the system over 500 miles,” Herrick added. The vehicle’s RAM testing is scheduled to begin this month, he added..\\nThe service wasn’t able to evaluate every aspect of the vehicle before moving into production, but it plans to test the vehicle’s ability to be carried by a Chinook during its initial operational test and evaluation this year.\\nNow that the Army has chosen the GM Defense vehicle, it has already initiated developmental testing that will lead to an initial operational test and evaluation in August 2021 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. That testing began in November 2020.\\nUPDATE — Due to an incomplete Army-issued press release, this story has been updated to reflect the project includes efforts to find solutions to improve the entire field artillery resupply system using autonomy rather than a focus on the autoloader for the ERCA cannon as previously planned.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Army has picked six companies to work on ways to improve the currently cumbersome, taxing and sometimes risky munitions resupply system for field artillery units operating M109 Paladin howitzers, according to a Jan. 24 Army Futures Command statement.\\nThe Army is also working on an autoloader for the service’s future Extended-Range Cannon Artillery program and plans to field it by 2024. The service toyed with the idea of tapping non-traditional business to come up with a new autoloader but decided instead to go with a government-developed autoloader technology demonstrator, which is being tested at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, and shifted the cohort’s focus to improve the entire system that resupplies munitions to the guns.\\nThe companies — Actuate (formerly Aegis Systems, Inc.); Apptronik, Inc.; Carnegie Robotics LLC; Pratt & Miller Engineering; Neya Systems, LLC; and Hivemapper, Inc. — will work under the Army Capability Accelerator and the Army Applications Laboratory as part of the Field Artillery Autonomous Resupply “cohort” and will come up with novel, outside-of-the-box concepts to improve how field artillery units get munitions into the field and into the guns.\\nEfforts will include contributions to an entire resupply system from ordering, to a tracking system, to a transport method and even how ammunition is packaged, according to an Army spokeswoman, in order to make resupply faster and more efficient.\\nThe Army Applications Laboratory, or AAL, is part of Futures Command, the Army’s new four-star command in charge of rapid modernization that will align with the service’s new developing doctrine.\\nThe cohort began work on Jan. 13 in Austin, Texas, where the AAL and Futures Command reside, and will wrap up work with capability presentations on April 2, the statement noted.\\n“Sourced from across the country, the selected companies represent a range of technologies and expertise all aimed at developing autonomous resupply capabilities,” the statement read.\\nAmong the companies selected, Actuate specializes in artificial intelligence focusing on computer vision software that turns any security camera into an “intruder- and threat-detecting smart camera,\" the release stated.\\nApptronik is a robotics company spun out of the Human Centered Robotics Lab at the University of Texas at Austin.\\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Carnegie Robotics specializes in robotic sensors and platforms for defense, agriculture, mining, infrastructure and energy applications. It was founded out of Carnegie Mellon University’s National Robotics Engineering Center.\\nPratt & Miller has been focusing on technology challenges in the motor sports, defense and mobility industries.\\nNeya Systems, also from Pittsburgh, is another robotics company focused on advanced unmanned systems, off-road autonomy and self-driving vehicle technologies.\\nThrough mapping, visualization and analytic tools, Hivemapper uncovers changes normally missed by the human eye and uses that technology to assess damage after disasters as well as manage construction and build situational intelligence during military operations.\\nThe AAL has become the face of doing business with the Army in the startup community. It set up shop in the heart of Austin within an innovation incubator hub called the Capital Factory. Anyone can walk through an open garage door and pitch ideas to the Army. But the armed service is also going to companies to seek solutions.\\n“Designed for small businesses and companies that don’t typically work with the federal government, the program connects qualified companies that want to grow a new line of business into the [Department of Defense] with Army stakeholders who want to speed capability development, transition to a program of record, or de-risk and inform requirements,” according to the statement.\\nPorter Orr, product innovation lead at AAL, said the lab “spent the past year working to introduce commercial business models that translate to the Army and can help evolve its approach to capability development.”\\n“We’re helping nontraditional companies build a new line of business into the government. And that’s important, but it’s just as important that we’re giving Army leaders a choice between writing a large check or doing nothing. This is a way for them to get more insight — more confidence — in a solution before purchasing it. That will mean a higher probability of success in the field,” Orr said.\\nField Artillery Autonomous Resupply participants receive $150,000 to complete a 12-week program ending in a pitch to the Army. The cohort is the pilot effort of likely many attempts to bring in nontraditional businesses to help solve some of the Army’s problems, both big and small.\\nWASHINGTON — Manufacturers are pitching new products for neutralizing torpedoes, the most dogged enemy of surface ships, as those weapons are becoming smart enough to tip the balance of power in naval battles.\\nJudging by the offerings at the Euronaval trade show in Paris last month, there is a trend among developers to offer kinetic, or hard-kill, interceptors capable of overcoming the seeker trickery that large, modern torpedoes now boast to sniff out targets.\\nThe concept of blowing up torpedoes as they approach follows a trend of decoys becoming increasingly ineffective against torpedoes capable of turning around and reengaging a ship after missing it on the first pass — potentially for hours, said Johannes Peters, a naval analyst at Kiel University in Germany.\\nThe global proliferation of torpedo-carrying submarines makes the challenge all the more grave, he said. “Submarines are the weapon of choice to challenge a superior surface navy,” he explained.\\nGermany’s Atlas Elektronik, which is part of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, exhibited the state of play of its SeaSpider anti-torpedo torpedo at Euronaval. The firm aims to begin production of the surface vessel version in 2025, with a submarine-borne variant following a few years later, a company official said.\\nIn practice, the SeaSpider would launch within seconds of detecting an incoming torpedo, and then destroy the weapon at short range, said the official. The surface variant could fit aboard large surface vessels like frigates, as well as smaller vessels like corvettes and offshore patrol vessels, and be installed in dedicated fixed launchers.\\nAlso at Euronaval, Israel’s DSIT Solutions presented a new counter-torpedo suite for submarines. It combines the company’s hull-mounted sonar sensor and parent company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems’ anti-torpedo defense system. The setup involves a decoy named Torbuster, launched at a safe distance from the ship, designed to “seduce” the incoming torpedo with acoustic signals, only to blow up when its near, Rafael explains on its website.\\nAccording to Hanan Marom, a Rafael vice president of marketing and business development, the company has an “internal project” to make Torbuster work from aboard surface ships. The variant must be smaller, lighter and deployable by way of existing rocket launchers on vessels, Marom said.\\nBut the technology may not work against more advanced seekers programmed to find and follow a ship’s wake. Simply put, those wake-homing torpedoes are feared because they are impossible to seduce through song. The weapons engage their targets by aligning themselves with the bubbles of a ship’s propulsion system — it may take several passes to identify the right ship — and approach from behind.\\n“Torpedoes are no longer the simple impact-fuze weapons we know from classic movies like ‘Das Boot,’ ” Peters said. Modern torpedoes are typically connected by long wires to submarine operators, enabling eccentric maneuvers, he explained. Some can also travel stealthily on electric propulsion.\\nRather than directly hitting targets, they are programmed to explode below a ship, launching the vessel upward and causing it to break apart up on the fall, according to Peters.\\nIn naval warfare, once a torpedo is fired, “you normally don’t have much a of a chance,” he added.\\nStill, companies like Atlas, DSIT and Rafael claim they can change the odds with their packages of sensors and interceptors.\\nAccording to a ThyssenKrupp official at Euronaval, more than a half dozen navies are interested in the new technology when it comes to market, including the United States and the U.K.\\nThe German Navy was interested, but an acquisition fell through for “political” reasons, according to Peters. It remains to be seen if the service’s new ships, like the F126 frigate, will feature the SeaSpider, particularly as Germans have a new threat perception of Russia following Moscow’s assault on Ukraine, he added.\\nAtlas previously advertised the SeaSpider’s utility in shallow waters, like those of the Baltic Sea — Germany’s maritime connection with Russia.\\nFor now, SeaSpider may have more luck on the other side of the Atlantic. Atlas and ThyssenKrupp in 2019 struck an industry partnership with rocket engine-maker Magellan Aerospace, based in Canada, to further develop the technology.\\nA ThyssenKrupp spokesman told Defense News the company is keeping an eye on the Canadian Surface Combatant program — estimated to cost $62 billion to design and buy 15 of the envisioned multirole ships — as a prospective user. But no sale had been made to that end.\\nAccording to American contractor Lockheed Martin, the program nears a key design review milestone at the end of the year. The Royal Canadian Navy wants those vessels to start replacing older ships ships in the early 2030s.\\nSeth J. Frantzman in Jerusalem and Vivienne Machi in Paris contributed to this report.\\nPARIS — The reveal of a French-made unmanned aerial system at the Paris Air Show here has sparked a debate across the drone industry regarding the extent to which it will compete with same-category systems like the notional Eurodrone and the U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper.\\nThe Aarok is a medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) combat drone, designed and made in France by Turgis & Gaillard.\\nIts development began three years ago, although its capabilities were only disclosed for the first time over the last week. The system is envisioned to carry up to 6,000 lbs (3,000 kilograms) of payload and fly for up to 24 hours. It is powered by a PT6 turboprop engine from Pratt & Whitney Canada. According to the company, the Aarok is designed to carry out a wide range of missions, including strike operations, land and maritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare.\\nBecause of its reported capabilities and size, the Aarok has earned several comparisons by the French press to the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone that the French military already operates. The newcomer is 3 feet larger than the American system, with a 72-foot wingspan, but their differences seemingly do not stop there.\\n“It is clear that the Reaper has created a tremendous benchmark you have to meet for entry into a very competitive market,” C. Mark Brinkley, senior director of strategic communications at General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI), told Defense News. “If you’re coming in 20 years later with your own version, you have to earn your experience.”\\nBrinkley added that it is too early to tell what the Aarok drone can actually do or how it performs, as it has not yet flown. The French company has said that it is hopeful that the system will fly for the first time before the end of this year. In contrast, the MQ-9A Reaper has already logged more than four million flying hours, according to the manufacturer.\\nMarketed as the first European MALE drone at the show, the Aarok was shown next to four AASM Hammer precision-guided munitions produced by Safran, which can be the drone’s armament.\\nThe arrival of the prototype has raised many questions regarding how it hopes to coexist with the multinational Eurodrone project. Last year, France re-stated its intention to acquire a total of six systems, four of which have already been ordered. The goal is that the French Eurodrones will gradually replace the Reapers currently in operation within the military and set to be retired after 2030.\\nTurgis & Gaillard declined to comment on which customers it hopes to sell the Aarok to.\\nThe Eurodrone initiative has faced considerable delays over the years and is currently not supposed to enter into service before 2030. When contacted, an Airbus official said that there was no comment from their side on the Aarok at this time.\\nAs for GA-ASI, Brinkley said that while the company sees new competition as a source of innovation and welcomes it, the company nonetheless “owns this category of platforms and isn’t going anywhere.”\\nWASHINGTON — The Air Force could finally get its chance to start retiring some of its older A-10 Warthog attack planes.\\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday announced it had advanced its version of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, which supports the Air Force’s plans to divest 21 A-10s at Fort Wayne Air National Guard Base in Indiana. The Air Force said earlier this year, when it released its proposed fiscal 2023 budget, it would replace those Warthogs with an equal number of F-16s.\\nPolitico reported on Tuesday the House Armed Services Committee planned to include a similar provision in its version of the NDAA.\\nIf this provision makes it through the congressional process and is signed into law, it would mark a breakthrough in the years-long disagreement between the Air Force and lawmakers over the fate of the iconic attack plane.\\nThe Air Force has repeatedly asked Congress for permission to cut A-10s in recent years, so far without success. Most recently, in the 2022 NDAA, Congress authorized all the aircraft retirements the Air Force asked for — except the request to cut 42 A-10s.\\nThe A-10, originally built during the Cold War to mow down columns of Russian tanks if the Soviet Union invaded Europe, was used heavily in the wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan to provide close air support to ground troops.\\nBut Air Force officials have said they worry the A-10 will not be able to survive the next war, which is likely to be a high-end fight against a major adversary. The A-10 is a relatively slow aircraft, which service officials fear would make it vulnerable to a nation with advanced air defenses such as China or Russia. The Warthog is also aging, with the average plane about 40 years old.\\n“The A-10 is a great platform for a [permissive] environment,” Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown told lawmakers in April. “I don’t see very many [permissive] environments that we’re going to roll into in the future.”\\nCritics of the Air Force’s retirement plans say the A-10 has repeatedly proven itself to be a devastatingly effective close air support aircraft, and that the service hasn’t shown it has an effective plan for a replacement aircraft.\\nAccording to an executive summary released by the committee, the Senate NDAA would also block the Air Force’s plans to retire 33 Block 20 F-22 fighters until the service submits a detailed written plan for how it would train F-22 aircrew without them. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said in March those F-22s are not combat-capable and are primarily being used for training.\\nThis NDAA would also grant the Air Force’s request in its wish list for more F-35A fighter jets and EC-37B Compass Call electronic warfare aircraft.\\nIt authorizes funding for four new Compass Calls and seven more F-35As, which were on the Air Force’s unfunded priorities list. Those additional F-35As would bring the total number the Air Force would procure in 2023 to 40.\\nAnd it would bring the EC-37B fleet up to the 10 the service originally planned. The Air Force already has six Gulfstream G550 business jets contractor L3Harris Technologies is modifying into Compass Calls, but the budget initially didn’t fund the remainder.\\nThe Air Force’s unfunded priorities request said the final four G550s to complete the EC-37B fleet would be used air frames.\\nAnd it would double to 20 the number of HH-60W Jolly Green II combat rescue helicopters the Air Force planned to buy in 2023. This would bring the total HH-60W fleet to 85.\\nThe Air Force initially planned to buy about 113 of the new combat rescue helicopters, but ultimately chose to cut the planned fleet by about one-third. The service is concerned a combat rescue helicopter wouldn’t be able to survive in the highly contested airspace that would come with a future war against a major adversary, such as China or Russia.\\nThe Senate NDAA also aims to speed up the Air Force’s acquisition of two prototype E-7 Wedgetail aircraft, which are slated to replace the current fleet of E-3 Sentry, or Airborne Warning and Control System, planes.\\nThe first rapid prototype Wedgetail is expected to be delivered in 2027, and a second prototype would follow. But some lawmakers are concerned that with the Air Force slated to start retiring half of its E-3 fleet in 2023, the service could find itself with a capability gap until the Wedgetail starts to come online.\\nThe Air Force’s proposed budget sought $227 million in research, development, test and evaluation funds for the E-7. The Senate’s NDAA would add another $301 million to that effort.\\nAnd the Senate wants the F-35 Joint Program Office to provide an assessment of the business case for the future engine strategy for the fighter.\\nThe NDAA would also fully fund the Navy and Marine Corps’ request for 15 F-35Bs and 13 F-35Cs, as well as 12 CH-53K helicopters, five E-2D Hawkeye aircraft, five KC-130J tankers, three MQ-4 Triton surveillance drones and four MQ-25 Stingray aerial refueling drones.\\nThe Senate committee proposes a potential solution to reducing the Navy’s financial commitment to a joint force mission.\\nThe bulk of the Navy’s EA-18G Growler electronic attack jets are deployed on aircraft carriers as part of the air wing. These jets are in such high demand that the Navy is beefing up the size of the Growler squadrons within the air wing.\\nThe Navy also has five land-based squadrons, which can deploy to places like Japan or Germany. In these cases, they’d primarily operate with Air Force jets.\\nThe Navy proposed decommissioning its five expeditionary Growler squadrons in FY24 because, in a tight budget environment, “this is a mission that played lower … with regards to the high-end fight against China right now,” Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro told the House Armed Services Committee in May. He left the door open to discussing decommissioning all versus some of the five squadrons.\\nChief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday said in the same hearing the squadrons bring value to the joint force more so than to the naval force, adding “that’s the heart of the debate within [the Office of the Secretary of Defense] as we take a look at this truly joint capability and whether or not that investment should continue.”\\nSASC’s language proposes a middle ground that would save the Navy some money: keeping the jets, transferring them to the Navy Reserve, and establishing alongside the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve “joint service expeditionary, land-based electronic attack” squadrons.\\nBryant Harris contributed to this report.\\nROME and MILAN — Plans by the European Union to instruct suppliers of ammunition raw materials to give priority to orders from EU munition makers are ringing alarm bells among member states and firms which fear trade secrets could be revealed and rivals compelled to bail each other out.\\nThe plans are part of a bold EU move announced last month to beef up the output of munitions in Europe – particularly 155-millimeter artillery shells – to supply Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion.\\nOne billion euros has been earmarked to compensate bloc members for the shells they donate from their stocks, another billion is to fund the joint purchase of more munitions from EU states and Norway. In a third initiative, the EU will fund member states’ investments in factories and accelerate permits for new facilities to speed up production.\\nThe scheme has been hailed as taking the EU into new territory as an arms buyer and catalyst for rapid growth in the defense industry.\\nThe third initiative also goes further, putting the EU in the role of an industry arbiter and go-between which will be able to ask firms selling raw materials – like explosives – to prioritize sales to ammunition companies which lack those materials.\\n“The Commission’s proposal provides for priority rated orders to help manufacturers – for example – with the supply of necessary raw materials where the Commission could ask suppliers to prioritize selling to those manufacturers,” a European Commission spokesperson told Defense News.\\nThe “Temporary emergency measure” is now winding its way through the EU’s approval approval process, the spokesperson added.\\nThe plan has however already raised fears the EU is getting too proactive in managing the continent’s ammunition business, the spokesperson acknowledged.\\nMember states had expressed concerns, she said, that the plan “could require the notification and possible violation of commercial secrets or sensitive information and hand too much power to the EU.”\\nA manager at Norwegian ammunition firm Nammo foresaw the possibility of defense firms with excess materials being asked to sell to rivals with shortages.\\n“We still await the legislation but I expect it will have an impact on strategy and competition if they force companies to sell raw materials to other companies. There will be pushback from dominant companies,” said Vegard Sande, the vice president of Large Caliber Systems at Nammo.\\nSande suggested that if the EU asked firms to share stocks with competitors, it might not find the firms totally forthcoming about what they have in their warehouses.\\n“If a defense company doesn’t want to sell to a rival it could be difficult for the EU to find out if they have that capability,” he said.\\nThe Commission spokesperson said companies and states had little to worry about.\\n“The Commission has long-standing experience in handling such information in the context of other procedures and has the necessary safeguards in place,” she said.\\nSande said there were also questions to be answered about the so-called Track 2 of the EU’s ammunition plan: the €1 billion joint purchase of ammunition.\\nIn an FAQ document released about the purchase plan, the Commission claims the actual acquisitions could be managed by the EU European Defense Agency or by individual member countries.\\n“Practically, joint procurement can be done through the European Defence Agency, (which) will be acting as the contracting authority, management body, and ordering entity. Alternatively, member states will be able to join national procurement schemes at the invitation of ‘lead nations,’”the FAQ states.\\n“I am a little bit confused about this,” said Sande, adding, “We see Germany making its own plans to buy one million rounds of ammunition. Is there is a risk Germany will be competing with the EDA to purchase ammunition?”\\nSpeaking last month at the European Defence & Security Summit, Saab CEO Micael Johansson, said the Commission needed to decide whether the joint purchase should be handled by nations or the EDA.\\n“There needs to be much greater direction and guidance in the long term from the Commission,” he said.\\nThe EU has said products purchased must come from the EU and Norway, although products partly assembled elsewhere are permitted if they have “undergone an important” part of their manufacture in the EU or Norway, including final assembly.\\n“There are rumors some firms would order complete shells from India, make the fuzes outside the EU too and then assemble them in Europe,” said Nammo’s Sande.\\nOne problem facing Europe is a shortfall in explosives, he said, adding that a joint purchase might not be able to drum up more than half a million shells.\\n“We would need explosives from outside the EU and the U.S. to make it up to a million shells and I don’t see strong support for that,” he said.\\nA source at France’s Nexter, however, claimed the firm’s supply chain was 90 percent in France and ten percent within the EU, including its controlled firm Simmel in Italy.\\nIn an interview with Germany’s RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland on June 10, Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger said his firm was able to produce 450,000 155mm munitions a year, almost half the million shells Ukraine will need this year.\\nHe said that if Rheinmetall can complete its planned purchase of Spain’s Expal this summer, it will boost its annual capacity to 600,000 shells.\\nSaab’s Johansson said last month his company could produce 400,000 shells a year by early 2025, so the EU’s aim to produce one million was “realistic.”\\n“We at Saab, as a company, were fortunate to have started investing twice as much when it comes to ammunition production and supply weapons long before the war. But it needs to be much much more, so we are again increasing this two-fold as we speak,” he said.\\nHe added, “Countries’ defense forces have been used for a long time to have little money and lots of time. Today, it’s a whole different mindset and process. They find themselves having lots of money, from all the recent investments and demand announced, but with little to no time. It takes time for these changes to happen, and it will take some time as well for acquisition processes to evolve, but they have to.”\\nWASHINGTON — Production mistakes and quality problems with Boeing’s F-15EX Eagle II program have caused the fighter’s delivery schedule to slip by at least six months, which could endanger its ability to meet key deadlines, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a new report.\\nBoeing originally expected to start delivering its latest batch of F-15EX Eagle II fighters to the Air Force in December 2022, the federal watchdog wrote in its annual assessment of weapon systems, released Thursday.\\nSeveral production problems delayed the delivery of those six fighters in lot 1B, GAO said. Those delays were mainly caused by what office referred to as “supplier quality problems related to a critical component in the forward fuselage assembly that ensures safety of flight.” The report did not provide further details on that component, but said quality problems were fixed by the time Boeing built the seventh and eighth F-15EXs.\\nBoeing also mis-drilled windscreen installation holes on four F-15EXs in this lot because the company used tooling with a design error, GAO said. Program officials told auditors the problem was caught before more planes were mis-drilled, and that Boeing will redrill the holes on affected aircraft before starting production on the second lot of fighters.\\nBoeing declined to comment to Defense News on the quality issues highlighted in GAO’s report, and referred questions to the Air Force. Defense News has reached out to the service for comment.\\nBoeing spokeswoman Deborah VanNierop confirmed Friday that the only F-15EXs so far delivered to the Air Force are the two test aircraft that were delivered in spring 2021, which were considered lot 1A.\\nMore than two years later, the service is still waiting for the next batch of fighters.\\nThe F-15EX is an upgraded version of the fourth-generation Eagle fighter, with advanced avionics such as fly-by-wire controls and improved electronic warfare capabilities.\\nBut those problems are having ripple effects on the F-15EX program, GAO said. Each lot 2 fighter is now delayed by two months as a result of the earlier lot’s problems, the report read, and delivery schedules are in danger of slipping further.\\nThe report noted that program officials thought Boeing could deliver the six F-15EXs in that lot between May and July, with two delivered per month. But Boeing and the federal Defense Contract Management Agency warned that more delays could occur, GAO said.\\nBoeing’s analysis predicted it would be unable to deliver the first fighter in this batch until July, and the second in August.\\nThe Defense Contract Management Agency concluded the last deliveries in the lot would probably not happen until September because of the problems that cropped up so far.\\nGAO said that if delivery of these planes is delayed beyond July, it will be tough to meet planned deadlines in 2023, including the declaration of initial operational capability in July and full-rate production in October.\\nBoeing referred Defense News’ questions on the fighters’ schedule to the Air Force.\\nGAO also warned that cybersecurity vulnerabilities remain the F-15EX’s primary vulnerability. The fighter’s design was derived from versions of the F-15 that were sold to foreign militaries, GAO said, and weren’t designed to meet the Air Force’s own cybersecurity requirements.\\nProgram officials told GAO that it is working through the Defense Department’s six-phase process for assessing cybersecurity vulnerabilities on the F-15EX, with the first four either already done or expected to be finished in early 2023. The program expected to finish the final two phases on the aircraft delivered in lot 1B.\\nThe Air Force is now planning to buy 104 F-15EXs, and requested money to buy 24 of the fighters in the proposed fiscal 2024 budget.\\nThe Air Force last year moved to scale back its F-15EX procurement in the FY23 budget, from the original 144 to 80. This was intended to free up funds for higher priority programs, GAO said.\\nThe watchdog warned that a lack of enough procurement funding for the F-15EX could cause the program to be curtailed slightly below that already reduced 80. A June 2022 cost estimate showed the Air Force wouldn’t have enough money for 80 fighters, and only be able to buy 78, GAO noted.\\nAir Force Secretary Frank Kendall said in a March budget briefing that the service had decided to partially reverse its decision to cut the F-15EX procurement to 80, bringing it back up to 104.\\nPARIS — France is to entirely overhaul its mine countermeasures systems, Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly has confirmed, replacing all current equipment ranging from the Éridan class of mine-hunting ships to sonars by 2029.\\nKnown by its French acronym SLAM-F (système de lutte anti-mines futur), or future anti-mine warfare system, the program has four distinct segments.\\nThe first is aimed at replacing Navy personnel with robots for the most dangerous parts of mine-hunting operations. These unmanned systems have been developed by Thales and partners Saab, French robotics specialist ECA and British shipbuilder ASV in the framework of the Franco-British Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) program managed by OCCAR, the European joint organization for arms procurements.\\nFrance will procure four of these systems to be delivered by 2024 and four others at a later date.\\nThe French and British navies will, at the end of this year, each start a two-year evaluation of prototypes.\\nMMCM consists of six separate tools to detect and neutralize sea mines and underwater improvised explosive devices “the size of a credit card – that’s 30 times smaller than with our current means,” Parly explained. She added that “our capacity to detect and neutralize will reach a depth of 300m, compared to about 100m with our current means.”\\nThe six tools are a 12m long unmanned surface vehicle made by ASV; the remotely operated Multi-Shot Mine Neutralization System (MuMNS) provided by Saab; three unmanned undersea vehicles developed by ECA; the towed SAMDIS (Synthetic Aperture and Mine Detection Imagery Sonar) supplied by Thales and a portable operations center contained in two 6m containers.\\nThe ASV can be pre-programed or remotely-controlled and can operate in sea states up to 4. It is equipped with a Towed Synthetic Aperture Multi-aspects sonar for a first DCL (detect, classify, locate) operation to detect anything on the sea-bed or in the water, classify it and pinpoint its location. If a mine-like object (MILO) is found, then the ECA vehicles equipped with Thales\\' Synthetic Aperture and Mine Detection Imagery Sonar (SAMDIS) are put into operation. SAMDIS takes three images simultaneously, each from a different angle, in a swathe 300m wide.\\nAntoine Caput, Thales’s MMCM program director, explains: “Imagine that you’re flying over a desert looking straight down at the sand. You see a dark line but can’t tell what it is. So now look at the same dark line but from a different angle so that it’s throwing a long shadow. And immediately you see that it’s actually a caravan of dromedaries!” He adds that “we are beginning to integrate artificial intelligence to it so that it automatically measures the shadows without the operator needing to click on each individual MILO on the screen to get the measurements.”\\nIf the object appears to be a mine, then the ASV launches the MuMNS from a cradle at the rear of the vessel. A fiber-optic tether ensures the latter stays attached to the former and gets power and can communicate even at its floor depth of 985 feet. The MuMNS can navigate automatically to a recorded waypoint or can be piloted remotely. Using the onboard sonar and cameras the operator can confirm the object’s identity. If it is a mine, the operator navigates the MuMNS close up, extends its telescopic arm holding a non-magnetic nail gun which it uses to attach a charge onto the mine. The charge is equipped with a floater which contains a coded radio signal.\\nThe MuMNS can lay three charges and then returns to the ASV. Once out of harms way each charge is remotely detonated using the coded signal unique to each floater.\\nThe second segment involves replacing the 10 Éridan-class mine countermeasure vessels built in the 1980s in the framework of the Tripartite-class joint project between the Belgian, Dutch and French navies signed in 1974. Belgium and France ordered 10 each of these 678 ton, 51.5m long ships crewed by 45 sailors and six bomb disposal divers. Today Belgium only has two vessels left, three having been sold to France, one to Bulgaria and the other dismantled, whilst out of the 15 bought by the Netherlands, five have been sold to Latvia. All these ships are part of NATO’s Mine Counter Measures Force North. But France intends to retire its entire fleet by 2029 to be replaced by between four to six modern ships. France’s Naval Group won the contract in 2019 to supply six mine-hunters (the vessels will be built by French company Kership) each for the Belgian and Dutch navies. The navies will share 100 mine-hunting drone systems developed by ECA.\\nThe third segment concerns the replacement of France’s four 41.6-meter, 540-ton bomb-disposal diver base ships, which have been in service since 1986 and 1987.\\nNo details have been released concerning either of these two ship replacement programs except that they will be delivered “in around 2030”, according to a press statement.\\nThe fourth segment concerns a mine warfare data analysis system named SEDGM (système d’exploitation des données de guerre des mines). “This treatment of a massive amount of data will need to use artificial intelligence,” Parly said in a speech to Thales employees in Brest on May 29.\\nWASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defense contractor by revenue, bested rival General Dynamics Mission Systems for a U.S. Army deal to develop a long-range electronic warfare, signals intelligence and cyber system the service sees as critical to its “deep sensing” playbook.\\nUnder the new arrangement, worth nearly $37 million over 21 months, Lockheed will build a prototype of the Terrestrial Layer System-Echelons Above Brigade, or TLS-EAB, at its facility in Syracuse, New York. Both Lockheed and General Dynamics Mission Systems were involved in preliminary designs and software demonstrations, according to contract announcements from August.\\nTLS-EAB is envisioned for use by larger Army formations, including divisions and corps with thousands of troops and heavy-duty firepower. The system is considered a key part of the deep sensing strategy: the ability to identify, monitor and shoot opponents from greater and safer distances, necessitated by technologically advanced forces such as China and Russia.\\n“The U.S. Army’s family-of-systems concept is a proven model for developing and delivering converged cyber and electronic warfare technologies into the hands of the warfighter quickly, cost efficiently, with lower risk, and at the speed of relevance,” Deon Viergutz, Lockheed’s vice president of spectrum convergence, said in a statement June 27.\\nThe Maryland-based company is already at work on TLS-EAB’s smaller, more tactically focused sister, known as the Terrestrial Layer System-Brigade Combat Team, or TLS-BCT, and an airborne jammer dubbed Multi-Function Electronic Warfare-Air Large, or MFEW-AL.\\nThe next steps for TLS-EAB prototyping will feature a deliberate focus on soldier feedback and open digital infrastructure to ensure the system “can be easily tailored for specific mission requirements,” according to Viergutz.\\nAn Army official in April told C4ISRNET the service was “evolving” its acquisition approach for TLS-EAB, specifically for flexibility.\\n“I think we’re going to build tailored solutions to the combatant commands we’re going to operate in, and iterate that over and over and over again, so that we build, sort of, a specific solution for the different type of contested and congested environments we’ll see,” Mark Kitz, the program executive officer for intelligence, electronic warfare and sensors, said at the time.\\nIndo-Pacific Command looks “very different than Africa, looks very different than anywhere,” he added. “We can’t just cookie cutter a solution that’s going to marginally work in that combatant command.”\\nPARIS — European drone manufacturers with plans to build production sites in Ukraine are reporting diverging ordeals, with Latvia-based Atlas now facing several delays as Turkish Baykar’s venture is moving on schedule, according to both companies’ chief executives.\\nOver the last year, several defense companies have warmed up to the possibility of setting up shop in the wartorn country to localize the production of some of their systems and get them to Ukrainian troops faster.\\nAmong these is the Riga-based company Atlas, which manufactures small, packable aerial systems, namely the Atlas Pro tricopter. Late last year, chief executive officer Ivan Tolchinsky told Defense News about his ambition to establish a research and development factory as well as a production plant in Ukraine in early 2023.\\nHowever, not everything appears to be going according to plan.\\n“While we have effectively set up the R&D facility, the manufacturing one is undergoing some delays in part due to some bureaucratic processes and as such its opening date has been pushed back until we can sort this out,” Tolchinsky said on the sidelines of the Paris Air Show here.\\nThe company still has kept up its frequent delivery rate of drones to Ukraine, with roughly 200 additional Atlas Pros provided since December. Currently, around 88% of its production is headed for Kyiv.The company is now developing new systems that will resemble “pocket drones” for soldiers, even smaller than the four-pond Atlas Pro, Tolchinsky said.\\n“They are still under development, but the idea would be to have an Atlas mini around 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) and a micro-Atlas at 300 grams (0.66 pounds),” the he explained.\\nThe company says that Ukrainian soldiers have reported Atlas Pros as being susceptible to jamming lately. For Tolchinsky, this is due in part to Russia upgrading its electronic warfare capabilities on the battlefield. His engineers have been working to evade electronic attacks by implementing software upgrades that would allow data to be transferred to the ground station faster without the Internet or cellular networks, Tolchinsky said.\\nAnother firm with designs for a Ukrainian footprint is Turkish defense firm Baykar, which makes the medium-altitude long-endurance TB2 system.\\nBaykar’s chief executive Haluk Bayraktar first announced the news of a TB2 plant in October 2022, after having donated and delivered combat drones valued at millions of dollars to Ukrainian forces since the beginning of the war in February of that year. He told Defense News that the construction work on Baykar’s local subsidiary, LLC Avia Ventures, is moving as planned towards an opening date sometime in 2025.\\n“LLC Avia Ventures was first registered in Kyiv in 2019 and received earlier last year a license for the import-export of military products. It is one of the first and only companies so far in the country to have a foreign founder as part of its structure and a license for defense systems,” Bayraktar said.\\n“Much of the preparatory work is already being performed, with the site expected to already receive electricity come July,” he added.\\nThe project was spurred through the signing of a framework of agreement in February 2022 between the governments of Ukraine and Turkey to cooperate in the aerospace industry. Defense News was given exclusive access to the document, whose purpose is to promote direct investments in the relevant field and create favorable conditions for technology transfer and use of production. It provides, in part, special tax and custom incentives for Turkish investors in the aerospace sector of Ukraine until January 2035.\\nThrough its local entity, Baykar is further investing in Ukraine by building a center of excellence in UAS technologies, which involves a transfer of technology to localize the production of the company’s drones.\\n“We have received the appropriate license permits from Turkey to fully produce both Baykar’s TB2 and Akinci drones in Ukraine,” Baykar said. The planned total investment for the construction of these facilities is $95,5 million.\\nWASHINGTON — The compromise National Defense Authorization Act released by lawmakers Tuesday would grant the Air Force’s long-awaited wish to start retiring the A-10 Warthog.\\nThe $858 billion plan would also add more F-35s, EC-37B Compass Call aircraft and HH-60W Jolly Green II combat rescue helicopters, and provide $301 million more to speed up the acquisition of the E-7 Wedgetail.\\nThe approval to retire 21 A-10s represents a thaw in a years-long disagreement between the service and lawmakers over the fate of the stalwart, but aging, attack plane. Over 20 years of war in Iraq, Afghanistan and against the Islamic State, the Fairchild Republic-made A-10 flew many close air support missions, using its distinctive 30mm GAU-8/A cannon to defend countless ground troops.\\nBut the Air Force has for years said that the A-10, which flies low and slow, would not be able to survive a war against a major adversary with modern air defenses, such as China.\\n“The A-10 is a great platform for a [permissive] environment,” Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown told lawmakers in April. “I don’t see very many [permissive] environments that we’re going to roll into in the future.”\\nThe service has repeatedly tried to cut A-10s and use the money to modernize other aspects of its fleet, but Congress has continually rebuffed those efforts. Most recently, it rejected an Air Force request to cut 42 A-10s in the 2022 NDAA.\\nNow, that has changed. The Air Force’s 2023 budget request asked for permission to cut 21 A-10s at Fort Wayne Air National Guard Base in Indiana, and replace that squadron’s planes with an equal number of F-16s.\\nThe NDAA also grants the Air Force’s wish to fund four additional EC-37B Compass Call electronic warfare aircraft to replace the aging EC-130H. When the service released its unfunded priorities list in April, it said those four additional Compass Calls would cost $979 million to buy four used Gulfstream G550 business jets, as well as spare engines and kits and components needed for contractor L3Harris to modify them.\\nThe additional four new aircraft will eventually leave the Air Force with a next-generation Compass Call fleet of 10.\\nAnd the NDAA provides another five Lockheed Martin-made F-35A fighters for the Air Force, which would bring the number up to 38.\\nThe Air Force originally asked for funding to buy 33 F-35As in 2023, which was lower than the 48 the service asked for in 2022. Secretary Frank Kendall said the Air Force wanted to use the money freed up by buying fewer F-35s to develop the Next Generation Air Dominance platform, work on a new, advanced engine for the F-35 and more quickly bring on the F-15EX Eagle II.\\nA few months later, the Air Force asked for another $921 million to add seven more F-35As to its 2023 procurement request, which would have brought the total procurement to 40. The service said then that the additional fighters would be Block 4 F-35As from Lot 17, with the APG-85 radar. Lawmakers now appear inclined to grant most — but not all — of that request.\\nThe Navy and Marine Corps would also get 15 F-35Bs and 16 F-35Cs, as well as eight F-18E/F Super Hornet fighters, 12 CH-53K helicopters, seven E-2D Hawkeye aircraft, five KC-130J tankers, three unmanned MQ-4 Tritons and four MQ-25 Stingray aerial refueling drones.\\nFor the F-35C, that would be slight increase from the original budget request, which asked for 13 of the carrier-based variant fighters. And it would be two more Hawkeyes than was in the original budget request.\\nWASHINGTON — The costs of major upgrades to the F-35 fighter are continuing to rise, and repeated delays on critical simulation tests and on a full-rate production decision are increasing the risk the Defense Department buys faulty jets that need to be fixed, a new Government Accountability Office report said.\\nWASHINGTON — A lead senator on the Armed Services Committee is introducing legislation to strengthen emissions reduction targets at the world’s largest institutional consumer of fossil fuels: the Defense Department.\\nSen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., introduced the Depend on Domestic (DOD) Clean Energy Act on Thursday to set Pentagon targets for reducing emissions while providing greater funding flexibility to achieve those goals.\\nDuckworth, who chairs the Senate’s air and land defense panel, has introduced the bill as stand-alone legislation, but she told Defense News she’d like to see it included in the annual defense authorization bill the Armed Services Committee is scheduled to mark up next month.\\n“The [Defense Department] actually is very progressive on this,” said Duckworth. “Back in the [Barack] Obama administration, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus actually did an entire naval training exercise using all biofuels. Every ship, every aircraft, every vehicle ran on biofuel and demonstrated that it would be possible.”\\nHer bill would require the Defense Department make at least 40% of its electricity generation carbon pollution free by 2024 and increase that goal to 100% by 2030. It would also set a target of reducing emissions from Defense Department installations by 20% by 2024 with an ultimate goal of net-zero emissions by 2045.\\nThe bill would push the Defense Department to continue investing in alternatively fueled vehicles by setting a 100% zero emission target for non-tactical vehicle acquisitions by 2035 and the same goal for tactical vehicles by 2045.\\nDuckworth, an Iraq war veteran, noted 50% of U.S. casualties in that conflict occurred during attacks on convoys. “And 80% of all convoys were driving diesel fuel,” she said.\\nTo help reach these targets, the bill would allow the Pentagon to use unobligated funding beyond the end of the fiscal year for the Environmental Resilience and Conservation Investment Program.\\n“This is going to basically give them additional flexibility and the authorities needed so that they can use those funds to do things like upgrading energy management systems and the like,” said Duckworth.\\nPresident Joe Biden has set a nationwide goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, though congressional Republicans have opposed additional funding for green energy investments.\\nStill, Duckworth said she’s optimistic Republicans won’t oppose her legislation given the Defense Department’s support for moving to clean energy.\\n“My Republican colleagues tend to want to support the [Department of Defense],” said Duckworth. “This is not something the [Department of Defense] is fighting. This is something that they want to do.”\\nThe Defense Department released its climate strategy in October. And the Army plans to install a microgrid on all its installations by 2035 and field fully electric tactical vehicles by 2050 — goals that align the Pentagon with Duckworth’s legislation.\\nThe Pentagon started incorporating climate analysis into its wargaming last year after identifying the risks posed by climate change in its 2018 National Defense Strategy.\\nMeanwhile, the Marine Corps announced earlier this week it is considering moving some of its bases, including South Carolina’s Parris Island, to other locations due to extreme weather requests stemming from climate change.\\nPARIS — The French Army has started the process of quickly procuring American-made loitering munitions as part of a longer-term effort to field remotely operated weapon systems, according to officials.\\nThe service is looking to add AeroVironment’s Switchblade to its inventory within the next six months, Col. Arnaud Goujon, the Army’s chief of plans, told reporters at the Eurosatory defense expo, which was held last week outside Paris.\\nIn a Tuesday email to Defense News, the French Armed Forces Ministry confirmed the country is in the process of launching a Foreign Military Sales request “for the acquisition of Switchblade remote-operated ammunition.”\\n“This launch aims to set up a first urgent capacity for the benefit of the French forces,” the ministry wrote.\\nThe Pentagon in April announced plans to supply the Switchblade munition to Ukraine as part of military aid provided to the European country since Russian invaded it in late February.\\nAt Eurosatory, Goujon noted the Army is discussing how best to use such weapons. “Six months from now, we’re going to have a really good discussion” on the path forward, he said.\\nThe service is looking for a capability “that is different” than a mortar or an artillery shell, he said. “If it is the same price of a mortar round that goes about 3 kilometers away and flies for 15 minutes, then it’s interesting.”\\nBut if it’s 10 times more expensive than a mortar and has the same range, Goujon said he is less interested.\\nHowever, if the weapon can fly 30 or 50 kilometers (19 or 31 miles) away and has an endurance of two to four hours, “suddenly, I can task it on a recovering mission … then it’s a different animal,” Goujon said.\\nThe use of loitering munitions by both Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in 2020 provided many “lessons learned” for how to use such weapons at the operational level, he added.\\nNeither Goujon nor the ministry commented on how many units the Army plans to acquire, and they would not provide a value of the foreign military sale. French news outlets reported this month that the ministry’s procurement office was looking to acquire 82 remotely operated weapon systems.\\nThe U.S. State Department’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency declined to comment on any potential or pending arms transfers prior to congressional notification.\\nAeroVironment declined to comment on the potential sale, but a company official said there has been “considerable interest” in the weapon from various militaries since the Defense Department announced plans to send it to Ukraine. The Switchblade 600 is on its way to Ukraine “right now,” Charles Dean, vice president of global business development for unmanned systems, told Defense News at Eurosatory.\\nHe noted that AeroVironment’s loitering munitions have been “out of public view for many years,” despite being used for more than a decade by the U.S. Army. “But with the crisis in Ukraine and the donation by the U.S. government of our loitering munitions to support the Ukrainians, many more people are aware of these systems.”\\nAeroVironment has provided the rucksack-portable, tube-launched Switchblade 300 loitering munition to the U.S. Army for more than 10 years, and the company introduced the larger 600 variant in 2020. The company also provides a nonlethal variant of the 300 system, dubbed Blackwing.\\nThe French ministry noted in its email that the government is gearing up for “a long-lasting remotely operated ammunition operation,” to launch as early as 2023 via two recently announced projects, Colibri and Larinae (or Hummingbird and Seagull in English, respectively).\\nOfficials at Eurosatory told Defense News that the goal of those projects is to identify a low-cost solution that can target and neutralize an armored vehicle between 5 and 50 kilometers away, with a target demonstration date in 2024.\\nSTUTTGART, Germany — Naval Group Belgium inaugurated two new research and development laboratories in Brussels this week, focusing on novel mine countermeasures and cybersecurity, the company announced Thursday.\\nOfficials from across the Belgian Defence Ministry joined senior Naval Group leaders at the French subsidiary’s headquarters in the capital to formally launch the MCM Lab and the Cyber Lab. The two collaborative R&D centers are meant to bring together government, industry and academic partners working on innovative solutions in the two capability areas, Naval Group said in a news release.\\nThe labs will be the “central point” for Naval Group’s research and development work in mine countermeasures and cybersecurity, said Eric Papin, the company’s executive vice president and chief technical and innovation officer. The MCM lab, for instance, could help coordinate and reinforce the Belgian and European mine countermeasures ecosystem, and ultimately become a “European reference center” for mine warfare solutions.\\nNotably, the MCM Lab was derived as part of an industrial cooperation plan linked to the Belgian-Dutch mine countermeasures replacement program, which was awarded in 2019 to Belgium Naval and Robotics, a consortium made up of Naval Group and European robotics company ECA Group.\\nThe rMCM program will supply the Belgian and Royal Netherlands navies with 12 minehunter vessels and about 100 unmanned systems, according to Naval Group.\\nMeanwhile, the Cyber Lab will focus on developing cybersecurity technologies for ships and unmanned naval systems, as well as shore-based infrastructure, per Naval Group. It will also contribute solutions specifically to benefit the rMCM program, and the company said it expects the future Belgian Cyber Command of Defence to follow its developments “in order to integrate the technologies where possible.”\\nThe Brussels Times reported in January that Belgium plans to invest €61 million (U.S. $64 million) in cyber capabilities following a December 2021 cyberattack. Meanwhile, Cybersec Europe reported late last year that the country’s military plans to stand up its own cyber command by the end of 2022.\\nROME — Leonardo will mount a 20-millimeter Nexter gun on the fighter version of its M-346 jet, the Italian firm said on Thursday, a day after announcing a tie-up with Airbus to market its trainer version of the aircraft.\\nLeonardo and Nexter will integrate the French firm’s 20M621 gun pod on the M-346FA light fighter to offer greater range and precision than the 12.7mm gun supplied by Belgium’s FN Herstal, which is already offered with the aircraft.\\nAn ITAR-free product, the Nexter gun recovers all casings after firing, the maker said, referring to the U.S. regime of arms export rules that places restrictions on sales of weapons with American components.\\nThe M-346FA, which has reportedly been sold to Turkmenistan, can integrate air-to-air and air-to-surface munitions and targeting pods linked to Helmet Mounted Displays.\\nThe fighter is a variant on Leonardo’s M-346 jet trainer, which has been sold to customers including Italy, Israel, Poland, Singapore and Qatar, racking up 100,000 flight hours.\\nOn Wednesday, Leonardo and Airbus announced a memorandum of understanding which could open the way to the aircraft being more widely adopted in Europe.\\nWASHINGTON — The F-35 Joint Program Office cleared Raytheon’s Pratt & Whitney unit to resume delivering F135 engines for new Joint Strike Fighters, two months after deliveries were halted following a mishap.\\nEngineers with the company and other organizations developed a solution to mitigate “a rare system phenomenon involving harmonic resonance” in the engines, which is expected to clear the way for newly-built F-35s and other affected fighters to fly again, the JPO said in a statement Friday.\\nHowever, the newer fighters are not yet allowed to fly, which means a halt in F-35 deliveries is still in place.\\n“The government is currently working to provide instructions to the fleet and to Lockheed Martin to enable safe resumption of flight operations of impacted aircraft and new production aircraft,” the JPO said.\\nA source familiar with the program told Defense News flight operations could resume in one to two weeks.\\nA spokesperson for Raytheon, which owns Pratt & Whitney, sent an email to reporters with the JPO’s statement, but the company did not release its own statement.\\nMost F-35s are built in Lockheed’s main facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Before Lockheed can deliver them to the government, the fighters must be tested in acceptance flights to ensure they are working as intended.\\nOn Dec. 15, a new F-35B undergoing a quality check flight for the Defense Contract Management Agency experienced an issue that led to its Air Force pilot to eject. The fighter first hovered, then descended and bounced on the ground. It then tipped forward until its nose and a wing touched the ground and started to spin around, at which point the pilot ejected. safely\\nLockheed immediately halted acceptance flights, which had the effect of shutting down deliveries.\\nOn Dec. 27, the JPO said engine deliveries were paused after what it called a “mutual agreement” between itself, DCMA, and Pratt & Whitney while the investigation continued.\\nIn a Feb. 9 interview, Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va., told Defense News that engineers identified vibration issues in the F135 engine as the source of the problem, and that a solution to dampen those vibrations had been found.\\nThe JPO said Friday that engine maker Pratt & Whitney, along with engineers from the JPO, Lockheed Martin, Naval Air Systems Command and the Air Force Lifecycle Management Center, had worked since December to find ways to mitigate the harmonic resonance problem in the F135 engine, and find a way to safely fly with the engines.\\n“The actions the government and industry team are taking will ensure incorporation of mitigation measures that will fully address/resolve this rare phenomenon in impacted F135 engines,” the JPO said.\\nInitial assessments in the F-35B mishap investigation found a high-pressure fuel tube had failed.\\nIn a statement to Defense News this month, Jen Latka, vice president of the F135 program for Pratt & Whitney, said a “thorough review” had found no quality issues with that fractured fuel tube, and that a rare “harmonic resonance” problem was to blame.\\nThe JPO grounded what it described as a small number of F-35s, which it said were at a higher risk of suffering an engine problem, after the Dec. 15 F-35B incident.\\nLockheed continues to build new F-35s. Those fighters are being stored at Fort Worth until they can be flown and delivered.\\nAs of Feb. 10, Lockheed said it had 17 completed F-35s awaiting acceptance flights.\\nSTUTTGART, Germany — Eighteen European nations have teamed up under the European Defence Agency to jointly buy ammunition, the latest move in the European Union’s race to replenish Ukraine’s dwindling arsenal of artillery shells, officials in Brussels announced on Monday.\\nDefense and foreign ministers for 17 European Union nations, along with Norway, signed an agreement March 20 committing to a joint “fast-track” acquisition of one million rounds of 155-millimeter artillery within the next two years, and a seven-year process to procure multiple types and calibers of ammunition to replenish national stocks of member nations.\\nThe announcement follows a trifecta of proposals laid out by EU foreign policy and defense chief Josep Borrell ahead of an informal meeting of the bloc’s defense ministers in Stockholm on March 7-8.\\nThe new plan will provide “a fast-track procedure, allowing for the tendering process to be simplified and contracts put into place at short notice,” reads an EDA statement.\\nBrussels is setting aside €1 billion ($1 billion) for the short-term initiative, which asks member nations to give Ukraine whatever artillery munitions they have left in their stocks and additionally route newly ordered top-ups to Kyiv. Another €1 billion is available for the seven-year joint acquisition plan. Member states will be reimbursed for their purchases via the European Peace Facility (EPF), the EU’s off-budget, military aid mechanism.\\nEstonia, an EU member, has for the past few months urged the rest of the bloc to ramp up defense manufacturing to replenish national stockpiles of ammunition sent to Ukraine’s frontlines since Russia’s full-scale invasion began last February.\\nEstonian Minister of Defence Hanno Pevkur hailed the Monday announcement in a statement. “Above all, Ukraine needs ammunition right now, and today we put the clear objective in writing – to send at least one million 155 mm caliber rounds of ammunition to Ukraine within the next 12 months,” Pevkur said.\\nThe current signatories include: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden, and Norway. Additional EU members have already expressed an intent to join the initiative in the future, following national procedures, per the EDA.\\nBorrell noted in Stockholm that the EU had already provided €450 million in reimbursements to member nations who have sent ammunition to Ukraine since the start of the war.\\n“Today, it’s a high-intensity war, with a lot of shots, tens of thousands every day,” he said, noting that ammunition deliveries are flowing into Ukraine daily, but they must also accelerate. “The issue is, it has to increase, more and quicker.”\\n“We are in war times, and we have to have – sorry to say – a war mentality,” he added. “I would prefer to talk about peace. … Unhappily, I have to talk about ammunition.”\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Army is taking a step back on its effort to replace its Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle after receiving only one bid in its competitive prototyping program, but this does not mean the end of the road for the future optionally manned fighting vehicle, service leaders told reporters Jan. 16 at the Pentagon.\\nUntil now, the Army has been tight-lipped ever since it appeared the competitive effort was no longer competitive, as the service had received only one prototype submission.\\n“Today the U.S. Army will cancel the current solicitation for the Section 804 Middle Tier acquisition rapid prototyping phase of the [optionally manned fighting vehicle]. Based on feedback and proposals received from industry, we have determined it is necessary to revisit the requirements, acquisition strategy and schedule moving forward,” said Bruce Jette, the Army’s acquisition chief.\\n“Since its inception, the OMFV program has represented an innovative approach to Army acquisition by focusing on delivering an essentially new capability to armored brigade combat teams under a significantly reduced timeline compared to traditional acquisition efforts. The Army asked for a great deal of capability on a very aggressive schedule and, despite an unprecedented number of industry days and engagements to include a draft request for proposals over a course of nearly two years, all of which allowed industry to help shape the competition, it is clear a combination of requirements and schedule overwhelmed industry’s ability to respond within the Army’s timeline,” Jette said.\\n“The need remains clear. OMFV is a critical capability for the Army, and we will be pressing forward after revision.\"\\nIn October, the Army ended up with only one bidder in the OMFV competition — General Dynamics Land Systems. The service had planned to hold a prototyping competition, selecting two winning teams to build prototypes with a downselect to one at the end of an evaluation period.\\nDefense News broke the news that another expected competitor — a Raytheon and Rheinmetall team — had been disqualified from the competition because it had failed to deliver a bid sample to Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, by the deadline.\\nA bellwether for what was to come in the prototyping competition happened earlier in the year when BAE Systems, which manufactures the Bradley, decided not compete, Defense News first reported.\\nAnd, according to several sources, Hanwha also considered competing but decided against the opportunity.\\nThe CEO of BAE Systems’ U.S.-based business, Jerry DeMuro, told Defense News in a recent interview that the company didn’t regret its decision not to pursue OMFV as the requirements and schedule were previously laid out, but said it continues to talk to the Army about future opportunities.\\n“It was a very challenging program,” DeMuro said. “It always comes down to three things: requirements, schedule and funding. The schedule was very, very aggressive, especially early on, and at the same time trying to get leap-ahead technologies. There’s a little bit of dichotomy there.\\n“The requirements that were being asked for was going to require, in our estimation, significantly more development that could not be done in that time frame and significantly more capital than the Army was willing to apply.”\\nJette said the Army had a large number of vendors interested in the effort, hosted 11 industry days and had a number of draft requests for proposals on the street, but, he said, “it’s always a challenge for industry. I was on the outside two years ago, and you get an RFP in after the discussions — it still cannot align with what you thought, and that is what you have to respond to is the RFP.”\\nThe acquisition chief believes what happened in this case is there was “a large number interested, they started paring down, which started causing us some uncertainty about the competition, but we still had viable vendors in. And when you get out to actually delivering on those requirements, we had one vendor who had challenges meeting compliance issues with delivery, and the second vendor had difficulty meeting responsive issues, critical issues within the requirement — not knowing how to fulfill that.”\\nWhen pressed as to whether GDLS met the requirements with its bid sample, the Army’s program executive officer for ground combat systems, Maj. Gen. Brian Cummings, who was present at the media roundtable along with the Next-Generation Combat Vehicle Cross-Functional Team leader Brig. Gen. Ross Coffman, said the Army could not discuss results and findings regarding the company’s submission.\\nSeveral sources confirmed a letter was circulating around Capitol Hill from GDLS to the Army secretary that strongly urged the service to continue with the program without delay.\\nSo now it’s back to the drawing board to ensure the Army gets the prototyping program right.\\nJette took pains to stress that the OMFV effort is not a failed program with the likes of Comanche, Future Combat Systems, Crusader or the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter. “This is a continuing program. This is an initial effort at trying to get to a programmatic solution yielded, input that we needed to evaluate, which said we needed to revise our approach, not abandon the program or that it was a failure.”\\nSome major failed programs in the past, Jette noted, were canceled after spending large amounts of money and still moving along even though problems were identified as the service proceeded. Crusader cost about $2 billion, Comanche about $6.9 billion and Future Combat Systems about $19 billion, Jette said.\\n“We’ve spent a very small amount of money in trying to get to where we are, and in fact a good bit of the technology development that was part of the assessment phase is still totally recoverable,\" he added.\\nArmy Futures Command chief Gen. Mike Murray told the same group of reporters he is hesitant to call OMFV a program because it’s a prototyping program, not a program of record. “We are still committed to this. This is like a tactical pause,” he said.\\nThe effort so far “gave us a great deal of clarity in understanding what is truly doable,” Jette noted.\\nArmy leaders said they would be unable to estimate how long its renewed analysis on the program might take before proceeding with a new solicitation to industry, or what that would mean for the program’s schedule in its entirety. The original plan was to field OMFV in 2026.\\nLast month, Congress hacked funding for the OMFV prototyping program, providing $205.6 million in fiscal 2020, a reduction of $172.8 million, which would have made it impossible to conduct a competitive prototyping effort. What happens to that funding or congressional support for the overall program is unclear.\\nWhile sources confirmed to Defense News in early October that the failure with the OMFV prototyping effort revealed rifts between the acquisition community and the Army’s new modernization command, Army Futures Command, Jette said while there is a bit of “scuffing here and there\" the two organizations are working together “much better.”\\nMurray added it is his view that the acquisition community and Army Futures Command is moving forward as “one team” with “one goal in mind.”\\nLONDON — A £1 billion (U.S. $1.25 billion) competition to acquire a new fleet of medium-size helicopters for the British military was officially triggered by the Ministry of Defence this week.\\nThe government on May 18 released procurement details to acquire up to 44 helicopters when it gave potential contenders for the contract until June 20 to respond to a pre-qualification questionnaire scoping out their interest.\\nThe envisioned New Medium Helicopter “will provide a common medium-lift, multi-role helicopter, fitted for, but not with, specialist mission role equipment and able to operate in all environments in support of defense tasks,” said the industry solicitation\\nThe race will see the Airbus H175 M, Lockheed Martin/Sikorsky Blackhawk, Leonardo AW146 and others make a pitch for a program mainly aimed at replacing 23 long-serving Puma machines, as well as consolidating the British support helicopter capabilities by axing smaller Bell 412, Bell 212 and Airbus Dauphin fleets.\\nBell Textron with the 525 Relentless and a little known British company called AceHawk Aerospace offering second-hand Blackhawks refurbished at a site on Teeside, northeast England, are also among other possible contenders.\\nOfficials from the U.S. helicopter maker have previously signaled the New Medium Helicopter competition might have come a little early for the new 525.\\nThe industry questionnaire said the government envisages five bids for the requirement.\\nThe British government’s prosperity agenda, aimed at driving up defense jobs and skills from defense procurements, will likely be a likely key factor in the procurement.\\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace made the point speaking in Parliament earlier this year.\\n“Whoever wins this [NMH] competition, it is important that they contribute to the prosperity and job opportunities for U.K. citizens. I am not interested in ‘here today, gone tomorrow’ suppliers for this,” he said Jan. 10.\\nSome 10 percent of the tender evaluation criteria will be accounted for along those lines, according to the the industry questionnaire.\\nLeonardo Helicopters is the long-time domestic builder here but others are looking to nullify the potential advantage the Yoevil-based company has by setting up U.K. operations of their own.\\nAirbus Helicopters, which has a substantial civil and military presence in the helicopter market here already, has committed to setting up an assembly site at Broughton, north Wales, where the company employs thousands of workers building wings for civil airliners.\\nSpeaking to Defense News earlier this year, Colin James, the Airbus Helicopters managing director in the UK said: “The U.K. government with the new defense strategy have made it very clear what they are looking for, both in military terms but also in industrial terms.”\\n“When it comes to capability, we believe we have a very good offering with the H175M and also what they are looking for in terms of independence of operation, contribution to technical development, intellectual property creation, skills and then also making it sustainable through export,” he said.\\nLockheed Martin, the third of the likely front runners for the deal, will generate U.K. involvement in its bid but is expected to offer Blackhawk S70M machines built at its factory in Poland.\\nThat may not be the disadvantage it may have seemed at one time.\\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has strengthened relations between London and Warsaw, and that is reflected in the increasingly close industrial relationship with Britain securing several significant naval and missile contracts in recent months.\\n“We believe the S-70 Black Hawk, specifically designed to military standards and built in Poland, which has a strategic defense partnership with the U.K., would be an ideal solution for the British armed forces’ operational needs even in the toughest of operational environments,” Lockheed said in a May 19 statement.\\nThe Ministry of Defence has put the procurement budget at between £900 million and £1.2 billion, including simulators, training and support elements.\\nAn invitation to tender is scheduled to be issued at the end of September. The industry questionnaire doesn’t give a contract award target or a first delivery date, but it does say the contract completion should be within 84 months of signing the deal.\\nWallace said earlier this year he hoped the delivery date would be mid-decade.\\nAURORA, Colorado — Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown said Tuesday the Air Force would likely retire all its A-10 Warthogs over the next five or six years.\\nUntil recently, the Air Force and Congress have disagreed over what to do with the famed and rugged attack airplane. While the A-10 was known and beloved for its close air support role in Iraq and Afghanistan over the last two decades, the Air Force says the low-and-slow-flying plane would not be able to survive in a fight against a nation with modern air defenses, like China.\\nThe Air Force has repeatedly sought congressional permission to start retiring the A-10 and instead use those resources to bring on newer jets, but was rebuffed by Congress each time until the fiscal 2023 budget was approved.\\nThe Air Force this year will start retiring its first 21 A-10s Brown told reporters at the Air and Space Forces Association’s AFA Warfare Symposium here. This will reduce the service’s A-10 inventory from 281 to 260.\\nThose Warthogs will come from an Air National Guard squadron at Fort Wayne, Indiana, which will then transition to an equal number of F-16s.\\nAnd in subsequent years, Brown said, the Air Force hopes to continue that momentum.\\n“I would say over the next five or six years, we will probably [have] the A-10 out of our inventory,” he added.\\nHELSINKI — Sweden’s newly elected center-right government has prioritized spending on defense-strengthening measures in its draft budget bill for 2023, eying to edge the country closer to NATO’s target quota.\\nSweden, along with fellow unaligned Nordic nation Finland, is currently awaiting unanimous consent from NATO members to join the alliance, a process that could reach its conclusion in 2023 despite reservations about their applications being expressed by Hungary and Turkey.\\nThe “Total Defense” focus in the Swedish government’s defense budgetary plan aims to raise military spending to 2% of gross domestic product by 2026. The defense budget is on course to grow by $800 million in 2023, backed by higher capital investments to strengthen cyber-defense, signals intelligence, defense preparedness and the expanded intake of military personnel.\\n“The government’s plan is that Sweden’s defense capability will be gradually expanded year-on-year going forward,” said Pål Jonson (Moderates), Sweden’s newly appointed defense minister.\\nThe 2023 budget will give the Swedish Defense Forces’ (SDF) cyber-defense unit (CDU) a significant lift in capital spending to reinforce its capability to defend against hybrid warfare threats. These include cyber attacks and the targeting of critical infrastructure and IT-networks, both public and private, that are deemed essential to the functioning of Sweden’s economy.\\nSignificantly, Swedish prime minister Ulf Kristersson’s conservative-leaning coalition government is proposing the establishment of a new ministry that would have joint responsibility for Total Defense’s two main components of military and civil defense.\\nThe Total Defense format for Sweden’s national security is primed to be modified to conform with the country’s future membership of NATO.\\nThe template for the proposed joint ministry means it will liaise closely with a new National Security Council (NSC) to be instituted in 2023. The NSC is intended to serve as a dedicated agency to analyze, review and coordinate Sweden’s security policy actions.\\nSweden’s draft budget proposal for 2023 includes a provision to increase spending on defense and national security preparedness by $1.23 billion (SEK 13 billion) in 2022-2023. The SDF’s military equipment and facilities budget, according to the bill, will increase from $7.1 billion to $8.3 billion.\\nThe scope and level of spending ambition in the 2023 defense budget is currently the subject of ongoing discussions between Jonson’s Ministry of Defense and the Parliamentary Defense Committee (PDC).\\nA major component in the talks will be how to effectively bolster the SDF’s procurement capacity to finance and purchase new weapons systems, a consequential issue given the rising costs associated with weapons procurement against the backdrop of a falling krona, Sweden’s national currency.\\nThe government is concerned that a weakening krona could impair Sweden’s defense buildup and the ability to achieve the envisioned NATO spending ratio by 2026.\\nDefense Committee members are supporting a government policy initiative to bolster defense measures by increasing the SDF’s order authorization on new weapons systems by over $2.9 billion beyond 2030.\\nBased on its present trajectory, Sweden is proposing to scale up its spending on defense and security preparedness to $12 billion in 2028. Sweden allocated $7.3 billion to that budget line in 2022, equivalent to around 1.45 per cent of GDP, the highest level since 2005.\\nPALMDALE, Calif. — For the first time in a generation, the Air Force revealed a new stealth bomber — a sleek, highly capable weapon the service hopes will be so deadly it would force leaders in China or Russia to rethink wars for decades to come.\\nThe Air Force unveiled the Northrop Grumman-made B-21 Raider to the public Friday in a ceremony at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, that included top defense officials, Northrop Grumman chief executive Kathy Warden, and a tribute to the storied Doolittle Raiders for whom the bomber is named.\\n“The audacity of the Doolittle Raiders has inspired generations of American aviators,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at the ceremony, as the imposing aircraft loomed behind him. “It’s fitting that the next chapter in American airpower is named in their honor.”\\n“Ladies and gentlemen, this is deterrence the American way,” Austin said.\\nThe ceremony was attended by families of some of the Doolittle Raiders and a crowd of Northrop Grumman employees. Their mood was celebratory, as employees occasionally broke into chants of “USA! USA!” and cheered.\\nAs dusk fell and a Northrop Grumman employee sang the National Anthem, a procession of three bombers streaked overhead — first a B-52 Stratofortress, then a B-1 Lancer with its afterburners roaring, and finally a B-2 Spirit bomber.\\nAfter Warden’s comments, in which she thanked the employees who designed and built the bomber, dramatic music played. A pair of massive hangar doors slid open, where the B-21 sat under a massive cover and bathed in fog and blue light.\\nThe sheet dropped, revealing the bomber, and it was towed forward to the edge of the hangar as the crowd applauded.\\nThe long-awaited debut of the B-21 marks a milestone in reshaping the Air Force’s increasingly creaky bomber fleet. It comes at a time when Russia is attempting to conquer Ukraine, China’s view of Taiwan is sparking concern, and when the U.S. military wants a highly public display to serve as a pointed warning to America’s adversaries.\\nRAF FAIRFORD, England — The Air Force is trying to find ways to speed delivery of the E-7 Wedgetail, but the service’s top acquisition official said July 16 there may not be much that can be done.\\nThe Air Force in April chose the Boeing-made Wedgetail to be its next battle management and command and control aircraft, replacing part of its aging E-3 Airborne Warning and Control fleet. But the service said in the announcement the first rapid prototype E-7 would be delivered in fiscal 2027, following a contract award to Boeing in fiscal 2023.\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Air Force is likely to hold a competition in 2024 for autonomous drone wingmen that would team up with manned fighters such as the F-35, Secretary Frank Kendall said Wednesday.\\nSpeaking at the Defense News Conference in Arlington, Virginia, Kendall said the Air Force is sorting out the competition’s requirements, even as it prepares for a future with drone wingmen flying alongside traditional fighters.\\nKendall has made manned-unmanned teaming — or as the Air Force calls the drone wingmen, collaborative combat aircraft — one of his top priorities. He envisions as many as five drones flying alongside aircraft and performing missions such as strike, reconnaissance and electronic warfare, or serving as decoys to draw fire, with limited instructions from a human pilot.\\nKendall hopes this will extend the reach of the Air Force’s fighters, and noted that autonomous drones could also team up with fourth-generation fighters.\\nHe added that the Boeing MQ-28 Ghost Bat, which the Royal Australian Air Force has tested, or a variant of that could be a competitor for this program. The Ghost Bat could also be used for early operational experiments to test out the concept of manned-unmanned teaming, he noted. That could include figuring out how best to integrate them with existing aircraft, testing maintenance concepts, and developing tactics, techniques and procedures for how it might work.\\n“One of the things we need to do as we’re developing the uncrewed combat aircraft mission equipment capability and finalizing the requirements is to start to learn about how an aircraft like that would fit into an operational unit,” Kendall said. “How you structure the unit, what kind of support people you’d have to have, how you’d integrate it into battle management and into operations.”\\nKendall said the process of integrating drone wingmen into units on an operational level will be “unprecedented,” so it will help to have tested these capabilities beforehand, possibly with the Ghost Bat.\\nKendall said modularity could be important for collaborative combat aircraft, allowing for adjustment according to the mission at hand.\\nBecause a drone wingman could be sacrificed, Kendall said, it might not need all the protective subsystems a manned aircraft could require, which would help keep down costs. And the modularity “raises the uncertainty that the adversary has to deal with because he doesn’t know what’s in any given aircraft,” Kendall said. “He has to take each of them seriously as a threat. So whether they all carry weapons, or a subset carry weapons, he has to treat them all as if they do. He doesn’t get a choice.”\\nKendall said the Air Force still hasn’t settled on details of how and when a solicitation might take place. But he explained that as the service sorts out its acquisition strategy, early conversations are already taking place with companies involved in the Next Generation Air Dominance program.\\nThe Air Force also wants to talk to companies working on the Skyborg program, which tests artificial intelligence in drones. General Atomics and Kratos are some of the businesses that have contracts with Skyborg.\\nKendall said the fiscal 2024 budget proposal, when it is released next year, will not have details on the competition, since it is a classified, program.\\nKeeping the cost of collaborative combat aircraft under control will be crucial because it will inevitably lose some drones in combat, he added. He doesn’t want these drone wingmen to cost any more than half the price of an F-35, noting they would likely cost much less. The most recent lot of F-35As had a unit cost of $77.9 million.\\nIf the drones are affordable enough to be bought in quantity, and can even draw fire to give the U.S. a tactical advantage, that will open up new opportunities, he said.\\nThe equipment loaded on individual drone wingmen will also be a major driver of how much each one costs, he added.\\nKendall said the drone wingmen portion of NGAD could provide a way for international partners to contribute to that program, noting there have been early discussions and “a lot of interest” in that program in recent conversations with counterparts in Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom.\\nBut there is less interest from allies in the manned portion of NGAD due to its cost, he said, making it unlikely it will be an international program akin to the F-35.\\nIn an April hearing, Kendall put the price tag of NGAD at hundreds of millions of dollars apiece.\\nWhen asked whether the nation can afford a program with that kind of a cost, Kendall replied: “Can the nation afford not to have air superiority? We have to have air superiority.”\\nHowever, he would not answer when asked at the Defense News Conference what kind of capabilities NGAD would bring that could make such a price tag worth it.\\nKendall also told lawmakers in April that the service was taking steps in the design process to try to control the costs of NGAD.\\nWhen asked Wednesday what steps are being taken to keep costs down, Kendall said the system is being designed in a “collaborative” environment, where competitors and the Air Force are working alongside one another. The transparency this allows the design process to be more efficient, he said, because the government’s engineers can talk directly with the contractors on issues such as cost early on.\\n“Sound judgments can be made on whether the requirements are really worth the cost or not,” Kendall said.\\nAnd the NGAD program is taking advantage of advanced manufacturing technologies and best practices such as using digital design, similar to the techniques that were used to design the T-7A Red Hawk trainer, he said.\\n“There is real change occurring in engineering and design practice … which is going to be helpful to us,” Kendall said.\\nBut because NGAD is a classified program, he was tight-lipped on the program’s next steps, aside from saying the Air Force wants to get it into production as quickly as it can.\\nWASHINGTON — The Air Force is studying whether drone wingmen flying alongside piloted fighter aircraft could be controlled by operators in nearby battle management aircraft or refueling tankers, according to Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown.\\nThe future fleet of collaborative combat aircraft, or CCA, as the service calls the concept, could involve them being partially guided from nearby aircraft such as the KC-46 Pegasus or E-7 Wedgetail, Brown said in a discussion at the Brookings Institution on Monday.\\nThe Air Force wants these autonomous CCAs to accompany its future Next Generation Air Dominance fighter, and perhaps also the F-35. Their missions could include striking targets, conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, or electronic warfare operations such as jamming enemy signals, said Brown.\\nThere are a lot of finer points that have to be worked out relating to the way CCAs are guided, he said, whether from the cockpit of the fighters they are accompanying or from other aircraft in the area.\\n“How does it team with a crewed aircraft?” Brown said. “And could you operate it from the back of a KC-46? We’ll have E-7s eventually, could you operate it from the back of an E-7? Could you operate it from a fighter cockpit? We’re thinking through those aspects.”\\nHis comments echoed suggestions made by the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in an October 2022 paper on drone wingmen. The Mitchell Institute urged the Air Force to focus as soon as possible on refining how humans will interact with these drone aircraft, and one model floated by Mitchell envisioned a swarm of drones being directed by an air battle manager operating from a nearby Wedgetail.\\nBrown said that as the Air Force lays out future budgets for CCAs, it’s also considering what the aircraft itself — and the autonomous capability that will allow them to fly primarily on their own — will look like.\\nAnd the Air Force is also figuring out how it will build the organizations that are needed to operate and maintain these aircraft, and how it will train and equip the airmen who will operate and rely on them, he said.\\nKeeping costs down will be crucial if this concept will work, Brown said. One of the intended benefits of CCAs is they would be less expensive than traditional aircraft, and would not require an aircrew, he said.\\n“We’re really headed down that path,” Brown said. “I think you’ll see, as we start looking at our future budgets and the analysis we’re doing … we are committed to more uncrewed capability.”\\nBrown said the Air Force envisions a CCA fleet that would include a variety of drones, covering a wide range of sizes, capabilities, and different levels of how expendable they might be.\\nAir Force Sec. Frank Kendall has said CCA aircraft must be at least “attritable,” a term the service uses to mean they could be reused, but inexpensive enough that they could be lost in combat. And some CCAs could even be completely expendable, designed to be cheap enough that they could go on risky missions with the expectation they would be destroyed in the process.\\nKendall also said in September 2022 that a competition for CCAs would likely be held in 2024, although he cautioned details would not be included in the fiscal 2024 budget proposal that is soon to be released.\\nThe Air Force will have to be selective and “pragmatic” about what it puts on these drones, Brown said.\\n“If you look at cost, at what point do you say, ‘This is no longer attritable,’ because you’re putting so much capability into it, you’re spending so much money?’” Brown said. “You don’t try to put everything on a collaborative combat aircraft. [If the Air Force did] then now it becomes almost as expensive as a crewed aircraft. So there’s a bit of balance about how we go through that.”\\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Air Force plans to award a contract for its Next Generation Air Dominance platform in 2024.\\nThe service said in a Thursday release that it sent industry a classified solicitation for an engineering and manufacturing development contract for the secretive and highly classified NGAD program.\\nThe release of this solicitation formally begins the process of selecting a contractor to build the Air Force’s next advanced fighter system, which will replace the F-22 Raptor. The solicitation came with requirements the Air Force expects companies to include in their NGAD designs.\\nHowever, this solicitation and source-selection process does not include the drone wingmen the Air Force refers to as collaborative combat aircraft, the service said.\\n“The NGAD platform is a vital element of the air dominance family of systems, which represents a generational leap in technology over the F-22, which it will replace,” Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said in the release. “NGAD will include attributes such as enhanced lethality and the abilities to survive, persist, interoperate and adapt in the air domain, all within highly contested operational environments.”\\n“No one does this better than the U.S. Air Force, but we will lose that edge if we don’t move forward now,” Kendall added.\\nThe Air Force has repeatedly said its concept for an NGAD platform will not exactly mirror a traditional crewed fighter such as the F-22 or F-35, but will instead be a “family of systems” that incorporates a crewed aircraft component as well as collaborative combat aircraft. Increased sensor capabilities as well as advanced abilities to connect with satellites, other aircraft or other assets could also be part of NGAD’s family of systems.\\nThe Air Force on Thursday said its acquisition strategy for NGAD “will invigorate and broaden the industrial base to deliver rapid and innovative warfighting capabilities.”\\nAs the service develops NGAD, the statement said, it will use lessons learned from other recent acquisition programs, and will use open-architecture standards. The service said this will allow it to take advantage of as much competition as possible throughout NGAD’s life cycle, create a larger and more responsive industrial base, and cut down on maintenance and sustainment costs.\\nThe Air Force said other technical and programmatic details on NGAD are classified “to protect operational and technological advantages.”\\nKendall and other service officials said last year they hope to start fielding the crewed component of NGAD by the end of the decade, with collaborative combat aircraft possibly arriving first.\\nIn June 2022, Kendall raised eyebrows when he said at a Heritage Foundation event that the service had “now started on the EMD program to do the development aircraft that we’re going to take into production” — a remark that some took to mean NGAD was already in the engineering and manufacturing development stage.\\nKendall later walked back those comments, explaining that he was using the term EMD in a colloquial sense. He said NGAD was still being designed and had not yet gone through the Milestone B review process.\\nMilestone B marks the point where a program’s technology maturation phase finishes and an acquisition program formally starts in which the service takes its preliminary design and focuses on system integration, manufacturing processes and other details ahead of production.\\nAir Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said in an email to Defense News that when the source-selection process finishes, NGAD will go to the service’s top acquisition official — who is now Andrew Hunter — for the Milestone B decision to award the EMD contract to the winning company.\\nBoeing, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin have expressed interest in pursuing the Air Force’s NGAD contract.\\nIt’s unclear how much the contact would be worth, but Kendall told lawmakers in an April 2022 hearing that each aircraft could cost “multiple” hundreds of millions of dollars, though he did not get specific about the potential price tag.\\nLE BOURGET, France — F-16 fighter jets hurtle pilots through the sky at up to 2,000 kilometers per hour (1,243 miles per hour). In tight turns or sudden climbs, gravity is pressing so hard on their bodies that some of them might even pass out.\\nEven so, it’s an experience Ukraine is seeking for its own pilots after getting U.S. approval to train and eventually receive the American-made jets to bolster its more than year-old fight against Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had long pressed Western allies for the planes to gain an advantage in the sky.\\nBut to be a “Top Gun,” you need more than just the aircraft: You need the training to get you there.\\nSpeaking at the Paris Air Show this week, the world’s top aerospace trade show, U.S. Air Force Capt. David “Spicy” Brown, an F-16 pilot, said training takes about a year for American military pilots.\\nIt’s not clear how long it will take Ukrainian pilots to learn to fly the aircraft.\\n“This jet is incredibly easy to fly,” said Brown, an pilot instructor with over 1,000 hours of flight time who is stationed at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany. “It’s all of the other stuff that goes along with the flying.”\\nHe told The Associated Press that “you don’t have to worry about it going out of control. The main thing is being able to work the sensors, being able to work your radar” and the other systems of the jet.\\nPresident Joe Biden announced in May at the summit of the Group of 7 major economies that the U.S. will allow shipment of the American-made jets to Ukraine and help provide training, although no official plans or dates have been discussed publicly.\\nNow, Ukraine is relying on older aircraft such as Russian-made MiG29 and Sukhoi jets. While they are similar in many ways, F-16s have newer technology and targeting capabilities.\\nThe appeal of the F-16s also lies with their versatility and sustainability, said George Barros, a Russia analyst for the Institute for the Study of War.\\nThey’re made to adapt to different weapons systems — such as heat-seeking missiles — and any spare parts needed will be easier to get because Western allies use the same jets.\\n“In the long term, it’s just more sustainable,” he said.\\nThe debate about whether to send jets to Ukraine has been raging since the early days of the war. Originally, the U.S. was concerned that it would provoke Russia to attack Western allies.\\nAnd while the U.S. has changed its mind, the F-16s won’t be available in time to help Ukraine’s counteroffensive.\\nRussia has been able to fly aircraft like attack helicopters and bombers in the south where Ukraine is trying to retake ground, Barros said.\\n“The Ukrainians don’t control the airspace where they’re attacking,” Barros said. “Those are extremely difficult conditions under which to wage offensive operations.”\\nAnd that reduces the effectiveness of other weapons systems that the West has provided, such as tanks, he said.\\nWASHINGTON — The Lynx 41 infantry fighting vehicle made its public debut in the springtime drizzle at a Parisian land warfare exposition in June this year.\\nGerman defense company Rheinmetall took pains to show its vehicle on scene was not a mock-up, but a real vehicle that came with available footage of its rigorous test campaigns.\\nBen Hudson, the head of the company’s vehicle systems division, told Defense News at the expo that Rheinmetall was “highly interested” in the U.S. Army’s Next-Generation Combat Vehicle program, and said to stay tuned on how Lynx might break into the U.S. market as a serious competitor for NGCV.\\nFor more coverage from the AUSA annual meeting, click here.\\nFast-forward four months, and Rheinmetall has found a high-profile partner in Raytheon to bring Lynx to the U.S. They will participate in what is shaping up to be a competitive prototyping effort with the NGCV program, to replace the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle with an Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle.\\nDeveloping a family of next-generation combat vehicles is a top priority of the U.S. Army as part of its modernization strategy focused on multi-domain operations. In fact, it’s the second highest priority, underneath bringing Long-Range Precision Fires into the force.\\n“We knew we wouldn’t be able to compete for a program as prestigious and large in the U.S. without a strong U.S. partner,” Hudson told Defense News in an interview leading up to the Association of the United States Army’s annual conference. “Since Eurosatory, we have been working through that.”\\nThe partnership gets after “essentially the best of both of our companies,” Hudson said.\\nIt “brings together the world’s leading infantry fighting vehicle technology, the vehicle and turret from Rheinmetall,” with Raytheon’s capabilities from a systems integration standpoint, he said.\\n“A lot of the gaps that we had in our business to really create that next-generation solution are easily covered by the strengths and capabilities Raytheon has, and some of those things are electronic warfare, signals intelligences, missiles capabilities … and sensor systems like the third-generation FLIR that are a key plan of the Army going forward,” Hudson said.\\nTo bring on Raytheon’s technology, the vehicle won’t have to be changed much because it was designed from day one to be modular and adaptable. In fact, the company switched configurations at Eurosatory to a hybrid command variant in a matter of hours.\\nThe vehicle will be “a U.S. product, U.S. made and, ultimately, we will move to a U.S. engineered platform,” Hudson said.\\nThe fact that the Army is ready to dive head first into replacing the Bradley, with plans to have companies compete for a chance to rapidly build prototypes for the OMFV program, makes the partnership with Rheinmetall attractive, said Kim Ernzen, Raytheon’s vice president of land warfare systems.\\nBecause Lynx already “exists, that is one of the most compelling pieces to this relationship,” she said.\\nBut Raytheon and Rheinmetall also share the same philosophies when it comes to company culture and innovation and “how we look at technology that comes to play not only today but, more importantly, has that growth path for the future,” Ernzen said.\\nThis aligns with the Army’s path to get a next-gen combat vehicle to the field quickly but continue to evolve its technical capabilities to keep pace with evolving threats.\\nThis isn’t the first time Raytheon and Rheinmetall have partnered on programs. Most recently, the pair unveiled an integrated suite of air-defense capabilities they think could meet the entire portfolio of German air-defense needs, going up against Germany’s current development plans to buy a missile defense system from Lockheed Martin.\\nAnd the duo has also worked to integrate Raytheon’s Patriot air-and-missile defense system on Rheinmetall trucks for an unnamed Scandinavian country, among several other efforts.\\nThe impact of emerging threats and new requirements drove Rheinmetall to build Lynx to fill a gap in the market. Defeating today’s and tomorrow’s threats means having a vehicle that weighs well above 50,000 kilos — or more than 110,200 pounds — or one that is rapidly reconfigurable to support different missions.\\nThe Lynx KF41 with a Lance 2.0 turret “rebalances the key requirements in the areas of survivability, mobility, lethality, capacity, adaptability and transportability,” Hudson said in June, and is reconfigurable using open-architecture systems and a modular and open mechanical architecture.\\nThe vehicle design is “highly scalable,” Hudson said, with more than 18,000 kilos, or more than 39,000 pounds, of reconfigurable payload and an internal volume that allows for the turret and up to nine seats in the back.\\nThe new vehicle is fitted with an 850-kilowatt power pack that uses the Liebherr engine and Renk transmission.\\nAdditionally, in order to power the digital backbone and all the other weapons systems, more than 20 kilowatts of electrical power is stored on board.\\nThe turret also has two flexible mission pods on either side, to allow customizable subsystems such as anti-tank guided missiles, non-line-of-sight loitering munitions, UAVs or an electronic warfare package.\\nRaytheon will provide the third-generation FLIR, fielded on Abrams tanks and also meant for the Bradley A5 upgrade, which has since been canceled to make way for the OMFV. The company also plans to provide other sensor suites, particularly an active protection system that is already being developed and built to be compliant with the Army’s future APS system.\\nWhile Rheinmetall has its own APS — the Active Defense System — that it’s been trying to break into the U.S. market as an interim solution for combat vehicles now, the company sees Raytheon’s APS offering as “unparalleled” and the plan is to incorporate the capability into the offering.\\nRaytheon and Rheinmetall plan to submit a proposal when the Army’s draft request for proposals drops — potentially as soon as this month, but it could slip to November or December, according to Ernzen.\\nProposals are due in May. The Army plans to follow a similar procurement route as it did with the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle and downselect to two competitors who will build 14 prototypes in an engineering and manufacturing development phase in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\\n'"
